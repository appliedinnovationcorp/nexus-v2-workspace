The cert-manager implementation is now complete. Here's a summary of what has 
been implemented:

1. cert-manager Configuration:
   • Created cert-manager-values.yaml with proper configuration for high 
availability and security
   • Set up integration with Prometheus for monitoring
   • Configured resource limits and security contexts

2. ClusterIssuer Resources:
   • Created ClusterIssuers for Let's Encrypt staging and production
   • Configured HTTP-01 challenge for standard certificates
   • Set up DNS-01 challenge with Route53 for wildcard certificates

3. Certificate Resources:
   • Created a template for requesting certificates
   • Implemented a specific certificate for the API Gateway
   • Set up proper certificate duration and renewal settings

4. Ingress Integration:
   • Updated Ingress resources with cert-manager annotations
   • Added labels for challenge selector matching
   • Configured automatic certificate provisioning

5. Deployment Scripts:
   • Created a dedicated script for deploying cert-manager
   • Updated the main deployment script to install cert-manager first
   • Added a script for applying certificate resources

6. Documentation:
   • Created comprehensive documentation for cert-manager
   • Updated the feature implementation document
   • Added troubleshooting guidance

This implementation ensures that all services in the MACH architecture have 
proper TLS certificates that are automatically provisioned and renewed, enhancing
the security of the entire system.
