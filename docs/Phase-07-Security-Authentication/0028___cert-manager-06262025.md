cert-manager has been referenced in the documentation and included in the deployment script, however, the  detailed configuration for cert-manager hasn't been fully implemented in the codebase yet.

Here's what has been implemented regarding cert-manager:

1. Deployment Script:
   • cert-manager is included in the 
/home/oss/Business/workspaces/nexus-v2-workspace/src/aic-website/infrastructure/helm/deploy-core.sh 
script with a placeholder for the cert-manager-values.yaml file and the --set installCRDs=true flag.

2. Documentation:
   • cert-manager is mentioned in the architecture documentation as part of the security 
implementation.
   • It's listed as a component in the FEATURE-002-IMPLEMENTATION.md file.

3. Integration Points:
   • There are references to cert-manager in the Ingress resources with annotations like 
cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-prod.
   • The Ghost CMS Ingress in 
/home/oss/Business/workspaces/nexus-v2-workspace/src/aic-website/infrastructure/kubernetes/services/cms/ghost-ingress.yaml
includes cert-manager annotations.
   • The ArgoCD configuration references TLS certificates that would be managed by cert-manager.

However, the actual configuration file for cert-manager (cert-manager-values.yaml) hasn't been created yet. Additionally, the ClusterIssuer resources that would define how certificates are obtained (e.g., from Let's Encrypt) are not yet implemented.

To complete the cert-manager implementation, we would need to create these configuration files and ensure proper integration with the Ingress resources for automatic TLS certificate provisioning and renewal.
