routing and security policies have been implemented in this codebase for 
both the API Gateway (Kong) and Service Mesh (Kuma). Here's a breakdown of what's
been implemented:

### Kong API Gateway Routing Policies
• Defined route configurations in 
/home/oss/Business/workspaces/nexus-v2-workspace/src/aic-website/apps/api-gateway/kong/kong.yaml
• Set up path-based routing for different services (backend, AI services, Ghost 
CMS)
• Configured path stripping and host preservation options
• Implemented protocol specifications (HTTP/HTTPS)

### Kong API Gateway Security Policies
• Added authentication plugins (key-auth, JWT)
• Implemented rate limiting for different services
• Set up CORS policies with allowed origins, methods, and headers
• Added request/response transformation for security headers
• Configured consumer-specific security settings

### Kuma Service Mesh Routing Policies
• Created traffic routing configuration in 
/home/oss/Business/workspaces/nexus-v2-workspace/src/aic-website/apps/api-gateway/kuma/traffic-route.yaml
• Implemented load balancing strategies
• Set up service-to-service routing rules

### Kuma Service Mesh Security Policies
• Configured mTLS in 
/home/oss/Business/workspaces/nexus-v2-workspace/src/aic-website/apps/api-gateway/kuma/mesh.yaml
• Added traffic permissions in 
/home/oss/Business/workspaces/nexus-v2-workspace/src/aic-website/apps/api-gateway/kuma/traffic-permission.yaml
• Set up health checks for service reliability
• Implemented traffic logging for security auditing

These policies work together to provide a comprehensive security and routing 
framework for the microservices architecture, ensuring secure and efficient 
communication between services while protecting the APIs from external threats.
