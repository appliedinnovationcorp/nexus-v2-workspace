HashiCorp Vault has been referenced in the documentation and included in the deployment script, but the 
detailed configuration for Vault hasn't been fully implemented in the codebase yet.

Here's what has been implemented regarding HashiCorp Vault:

1. Deployment Script:
   • HashiCorp Vault is included in the 
/home/oss/Business/workspaces/nexus-v2-workspace/src/aic-website/infrastructure/helm/deploy-core.sh 
script with a placeholder for the vault-values.yaml file.

2. Documentation:
   • Vault is mentioned in the architecture documentation as part of the security implementation.
   • It's listed as a component in the FEATURE-002-IMPLEMENTATION.md file.

However, the actual configuration file for HashiCorp Vault (vault-values.yaml) hasn't been created 
yet. This file would contain the detailed configuration for Vault, including storage backend settings,
authentication methods, secret engines, and resource allocations.

To complete the HashiCorp Vault implementation, we would need to create this configuration file and 
ensure proper integration with the other components of the security stack, particularly with 
Kubernetes for service account authentication and secret injection.
