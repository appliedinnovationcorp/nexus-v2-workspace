Keycloak has been referenced in the documentation and included in the deployment script, but the detailed 
configuration for Keycloak hasn't been fully implemented in the codebase yet.

Here's what has been implemented regarding Keycloak:

1. Deployment Script:
   • Keycloak is included in the 
/home/oss/Business/workspaces/nexus-v2-workspace/src/aic-website/infrastructure/helm/deploy-core.sh 
script with a placeholder for the keycloak-values.yaml file.

2. Documentation:
   • Keycloak is mentioned in the architecture documentation as part of the security implementation.
   • It's listed as a component in the FEATURE-002-IMPLEMENTATION.md file.

3. Integration Points:
   • ArgoCD is configured to use Keycloak for OIDC authentication in the argocd-values.yaml file.

However, the actual configuration file for Keycloak (keycloak-values.yaml) hasn't been created yet. 
This file would contain the detailed configuration for Keycloak, including realm settings, client 
configurations, user federation, and resource allocations.

To complete the Keycloak implementation, we would need to create this configuration file and ensure 
proper integration with the other components of the security stack, particularly with the API Gateway 
and frontend applications for authentication.
