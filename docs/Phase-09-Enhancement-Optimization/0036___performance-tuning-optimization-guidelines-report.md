The performance tuning and optimization guidelines are now complete. Here's a 
summary of what has been implemented:

1. Comprehensive Performance Tuning Guidelines:
   • Created a detailed PERFORMANCE-TUNING-GUIDELINES.md document covering all 
aspects of performance optimization
   • Included specific recommendations for infrastructure, Kubernetes, API 
Gateway, service mesh, databases, caching, microservices, and frontend
   • Provided code examples and configuration snippets for each area
   • Included monitoring and profiling guidance

2. Load Testing Infrastructure:
   • Created a k6 load testing script with realistic user scenarios
   • Implemented custom metrics for tracking performance
   • Added different test scenarios (browsing, API-heavy, spike)
   • Set up thresholds for pass/fail criteria

3. Performance Test Automation:
   • Created a script to run performance tests and generate reports
   • Added Kubernetes job configuration for running tests in the cluster
   • Implemented integration with Prometheus for metrics collection
   • Set up HTML report generation for easy analysis

4. Database Optimization:
   • Created a PostgreSQL optimization script with optimal configuration
   • Added index creation for common queries
   • Implemented table partitioning for large tables
   • Set up maintenance routines for ongoing optimization

5. Redis Optimization:
   • Created an optimized Redis configuration file
   • Tuned memory management settings
   • Configured eviction policies for caching
   • Optimized persistence settings for performance

6. Kubernetes Scaling Configuration:
   • Created HorizontalPodAutoscaler configurations for key services
   • Implemented custom metrics for scaling decisions
   • Configured scaling behavior for different scenarios
   • Set appropriate stabilization windows to prevent thrashing

7. Documentation and References:
   • Created a README file with usage instructions
   • Added references to official documentation
   • Included best practices for ongoing optimization
   • Linked performance requirements to implementation

This implementation provides a comprehensive approach to performance tuning and 
optimization, ensuring that the MACH architecture meets the performance 
requirements specified in Feature 002.
