assessment on whether you can safely remove /infra/terraform/:

## Analysis Summary

Architecture Differences:
• **Old (/infra/terraform/)**: ECS-based architecture with ALB, RDS, DocumentDB, CloudFront
• **New (/infrastructure/terraform/)**: EKS-based (Kubernetes) architecture with modern MACH 
principles

Key Differences:

| Aspect | Old Setup | New Setup |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Container Platform | ECS | EKS (Kubernetes) |
| State Management | Local state (no backend) | Remote S3 backend |
| Architecture | Traditional monolithic | MACH (Microservices, API-first, Cloud-native, Headless
) |
| Terraform Version | AWS Provider ~> 5.0 | AWS Provider ~> 4.0 |
| Database | PostgreSQL + DocumentDB | PostgreSQL + Redis |

## Safety Assessment: ⚠️ PROCEED WITH CAUTION

### Before Removing /infra/terraform/:

1. Check for Active Infrastructure:
   • The old setup has no remote backend, so state might be local
   • Run terraform show in /infra/terraform/ to check if resources exist

2. Update References: These files reference the old path:
   • .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml (CI/CD pipeline)
   • package.json (npm scripts)
   • scripts/deploy.sh (deployment script)
   • docs/development.md (documentation)

3. Verify Migration: Ensure the new infrastructure covers all your needs:
   • The new setup doesn't include DocumentDB or CloudFront
   • Different database setup (Redis instead of DocumentDB)

## Recommended Steps:

1. First, check if old infrastructure is deployed:
  
bash
   cd /home/oss/Business/workspaces/nexus-v2-workspace/src/aic-website/infra/terraform
   terraform show
   


2. If resources exist, plan migration:
   • Export data from old databases
   • Plan resource migration strategy
   • Consider blue-green deployment

3. Update all references to point to /infrastructure/terraform/

4. Only then remove /infra/terraform/

Recommendation: Don't remove the old directory yet. First verify no active resources exist and 
update all references. The architectures are significantly different, so this requires careful 
migration planning rather than simple removal.
