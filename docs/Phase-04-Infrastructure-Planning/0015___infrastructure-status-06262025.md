## Infrastructure Status: NOT DEPLOYED ❌

### Evidence Summary:

Terraform State:
• ✅ Terraform configurations exist in /infrastructure/terraform/
• ❌ No .terraform directories (not initialized)
• ❌ No terraform.tfstate files (never applied)
• ❌ No terraform.tfvars files (no custom configuration)

AWS Resources:
• ❌ No EKS clusters found in us-west-2
• ❌ No RDS instances found
• ❌ No ElastiCache Redis clusters found
• ❌ No custom VPCs with project tags found

Kubernetes:
• ✅ Kubernetes manifests exist in /infrastructure/kubernetes/
• ❌ No kubectl cluster configured
• ❌ Cannot access any Kubernetes cluster

Configuration:
• ✅ Environment templates reference local services (localhost)
• ❌ No AWS-specific environment variables configured

## What Exists vs. What's Deployed:

| Component | Configuration | Deployment Status |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| EKS Cluster | ✅ Defined in Terraform | ❌ Not deployed |
| VPC & Networking | ✅ Defined with modules | ❌ Not deployed |
| RDS PostgreSQL | ✅ Defined with module | ❌ Not deployed |
| ElastiCache Redis | ✅ Defined in Terraform | ❌ Not deployed |
| Kubernetes Manifests | ✅ Complete YAML files | ❌ Not applied |
| Helm Charts | ✅ Directory structure | ❌ Not deployed |

## Current State:

The codebase contains comprehensive infrastructure-as-code definitions but none of the AWS 
infrastructure has been deployed. The application appears to be running in development mode 
with local services:

• Local PostgreSQL database
• Local MongoDB 
• Local Redis
• Local development server

## To Deploy the Infrastructure:

1. Initialize Terraform:
  bash
   cd infrastructure/terraform
   terraform init
   

2. Plan and Apply:
  bash
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   

3. Configure kubectl:
  bash
   aws eks update-kubeconfig --region us-west-2 --name aic-website-cluster
   

4. Deploy Kubernetes resources:
  bash
   kubectl apply -f infrastructure/kubernetes/
   

Summary: The infrastructure code is well-designed and ready for deployment, but currently 
nothing has been deployed to AWS. The system is running entirely in local development mode.
