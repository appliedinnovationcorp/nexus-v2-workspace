### Defined Namespaces:

The Kubernetes configuration includes 8 well-organized namespaces in 
/infrastructure/kubernetes/namespaces.yaml:

| Namespace | Purpose | Tier | Usage |
|-----------|---------|------|-------|
| api-gateway | API Gateway services | Frontend | Kong API Gateway |
| backend-services | Core backend services | Backend | Main application services |
| ai-services | AI/ML services | Backend | AI processing services |
| cms | Content Management | Backend | Ghost CMS |
| observability | Monitoring & logging | Infrastructure | Prometheus, Grafana, ELK |
| security | Security services | Infrastructure | Vault, Keycloak |
| storage | Storage services | Infrastructure | MinIO, Longhorn |
| messaging | Message queues | Infrastructure | Kafka, Redis |

### Namespace Organization:

Tier-based Architecture:
• **Frontend Tier**: api-gateway
• **Backend Tier**: backend-services, ai-services, cms
• **Infrastructure Tier**: observability, security, storage, messaging

Consistent Labeling:
Each namespace includes standardized labels:
• name: Namespace identifier
• part-of: aic-website (project identifier)
• tier: Architecture tier classification

### Service-to-Namespace Mapping:

The services are properly mapped to their respective namespaces:
• Backend services → backend-services
• AI services → ai-services
• CMS (Ghost) → cms
• And so on...

### Deployment Status:

Configuration: ✅ Complete and well-structured
Deployment: ❌ Not applied to any cluster (no EKS cluster exists yet)

The namespace definitions follow Kubernetes best practices with proper separation of concerns 
and clear organizational structure, ready for deployment once the EKS cluster is provisioned.
