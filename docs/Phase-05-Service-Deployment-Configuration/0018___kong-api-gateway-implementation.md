The API Gateway implementation using Kong with Kuma 
for a universal service mesh is now complete. Here's 
a summary of what we've accomplished:

1. Kong API Gateway Configuration:
   • Set up Kong as the API Gateway
   • Configured routes for different services
   • Added authentication, rate limiting, and CORS 
plugins
   • Created consumer configurations

2. Kuma Service Mesh Configuration:
   • Set up Kuma for service mesh capabilities
   • Configured traffic routing, permissions, and 
logging
   • Added health checks for services

3. Observability Stack:
   • Integrated Prometheus for metrics collection
   • Set up Grafana for visualization
   • Added Zipkin for distributed tracing

4. Mock Services:
   • Created mock backend and AI services for 
development
   • Added sample API responses

5. Documentation:
   • Created comprehensive architecture documentation
   • Added production deployment guide
   • Included security and scaling considerations

6. Local Development Environment:
   • Set up Docker Compose for local development
   • Created startup scripts

This implementation provides a robust, scalable, and 
secure API Gateway solution that can handle the needs
of your microservices architecture. The Kong/Kuma 
combination offers advanced features like service 
discovery, traffic management, and observability that
would be difficult to implement with a simple 
Express-based gateway.
