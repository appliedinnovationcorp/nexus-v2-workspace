## Microservice Deployments Status: PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED ⚠️

### What's Been Implemented: ✅

Kubernetes Deployment Configurations:
• **3 Microservices** with complete Kubernetes manifests
• **Production-ready** deployment specifications
• **Enterprise-grade** configurations with proper resource management

| Microservice | Status | Components | Image |
|-------------|--------|------------|-------|
| Backend API | ✅ Fully Configured | Deployment, Service, HPA, ConfigMap 
| ghcr.io/applied-innovation-corp/aic-website/backend-api:latest |
| AI Services | ✅ Fully Configured | Deployment, Service, HPA, PVC | 
ghcr.io/applied-innovation-corp/aic-website/ai-services:latest |
| Ghost CMS | ✅ Fully Configured | Deployment, Service, Ingress, PVC | 
ghost:5.33.0 (official image) |

### Deployment Features Implemented:

Enterprise-Grade Features:
• ✅ Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) - CPU/Memory based scaling
• ✅ Rolling Updates - Zero-downtime deployments
• ✅ Health Checks - Liveness and readiness probes
• ✅ Resource Management - CPU/Memory requests and limits
• ✅ Security Context - Non-root user, proper permissions
• ✅ Pod Anti-Affinity - High availability across nodes
• ✅ Service Mesh Integration - Kuma annotations
• ✅ Monitoring Integration - Prometheus scraping
• ✅ Configuration Management - ConfigMaps and Secrets
• ✅ Persistent Storage - PVCs for stateful data

Backend API Service:

Ghost CMS:
yaml
- Replicas: 2 for high availability
- Database: MySQL integration
- Storage: Persistent volume for content
- Mail: SMTP/Mailgun integration
- Official Ghost 5.33.0 image


### What's Missing: ❌

Source Code Implementation:
• ❌ No actual microservice code - /services/ directories are empty
• ❌ No Docker images built - References non-existent container images
• ❌ No CI/CD for services - No build/push pipelines for custom images

Planned but Not Implemented Services:
• user-service - Empty directory
• lead-service - Empty directory  
• content-service - Empty directory
• ai-engine - Empty directory
• event-store - Empty directory
• saga-orchestrator - Empty directory
• event-bus - Empty directory

### Summary:

Infrastructure: ✅ Production-ready Kubernetes configurations
Implementation: ❌ No actual microservice source code
Deployment: ❌ Cannot deploy (missing container images)

The codebase has excellent microservice deployment architecture but lacks 
the actual microservice implementations. The Kubernetes manifests are 
enterprise-grade and ready for production, but you need to:

1. Implement the microservice source code
2. Build and push Docker images
3. Set up CI/CD pipelines
4. Deploy to the EKS cluster

This represents a solid foundation for a microservices architecture with 
all the operational concerns properly addressed.
