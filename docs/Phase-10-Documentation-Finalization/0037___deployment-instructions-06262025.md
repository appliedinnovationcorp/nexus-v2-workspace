deployment instructions have been provided in this codebase as part of the documentation for 
Feature 002: Full MACH architecture. The deployment instructions can be found in several places:

1. Main README File:
   • The /home/oss/Business/workspaces/nexus-v2-workspace/src/aic-website/infrastructure/README.md 
includes a "Getting Started" section with deployment steps:
    

     1. Set up infrastructure using Terraform:
        cd terraform
        terraform init
        terraform apply

     2. Deploy core components with Helm:
        cd helm
        ./deploy-core.sh

     3. Configure ArgoCD for GitOps:
        cd argocd
        ./setup-argocd.sh

     4. Deploy microservices:
        cd kubernetes
        kubectl apply -f namespaces.yaml
        kubectl apply -f services/
     


2. Deployment Scripts:
   • The 
/home/oss/Business/workspaces/nexus-v2-workspace/src/aic-website/infrastructure/helm/deploy-core.sh 
script provides detailed steps for deploying all core components using Helm.
   • The 
/home/oss/Business/workspaces/nexus-v2-workspace/src/aic-website/infrastructure/argocd/setup-argocd.sh
script includes instructions for setting up ArgoCD for GitOps deployments.

3. Production Deployment Guide:
   • The 
/home/oss/Business/workspaces/nexus-v2-workspace/src/aic-website/apps/api-gateway/docs/production-deployment.md
file contains comprehensive instructions for deploying the API Gateway and Service Mesh in production
environments.
   • This guide covers Kubernetes deployment, VM-based deployment, and hybrid deployment options.

4. CI/CD Pipeline Configuration:
   • The CI/CD configuration files (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins) include deployment automation 
that serves as documentation for the deployment process.

5. Feature Implementation Document:
   • The 
/home/oss/Business/workspaces/nexus-v2-workspace/src/aic-website/infrastructure/FEATURE-002-IMPLEMENTATION.md
includes a "Next Steps" section that outlines the deployment sequence.

These deployment instructions provide a comprehensive guide for setting up the entire MACH 
architecture, from infrastructure provisioning to application deployment, using a combination of 
Terraform, Helm, Kubernetes manifests, and GitOps practices.
