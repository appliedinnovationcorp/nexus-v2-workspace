The API Reference Documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger specifications is now 
complete. Here's a summary of what has been implemented:

1. Backend API Specification:
   • Created comprehensive OpenAPI 3.0 specification for the Backend API
   • Defined endpoints for authentication, users, content, and settings
   • Included detailed schema definitions for all request and response 
objects
   • Added security schemes for JWT authentication
   • Documented error responses and status codes

2. AI Services API Specification:
   • Created OpenAPI 3.0 specification for the AI Services API
   • Defined endpoints for content generation, image analysis, 
recommendations, and NLP
   • Included detailed schema definitions for all AI-related objects
   • Added security schemes and authentication requirements
   • Documented rate limiting and error handling

3. CMS API Specification:
   • Created OpenAPI 3.0 specification for the CMS API (based on Ghost CMS)
   • Defined endpoints for posts, pages, authors, tags, media, and settings
   • Included detailed schema definitions in a separate file for better 
organization
   • Added security schemes for API key authentication
   • Documented pagination and filtering options

4. Documentation Generation:
   • Created a script to generate interactive HTML documentation using 
Swagger UI
   • Set up a unified interface to explore all three APIs
   • Added a selector to switch between different API specifications
   • Included styling and branding for the documentation

5. Documentation README:
   • Created a comprehensive README file explaining the API documentation
   • Included information about directory structure, API specifications, and 
usage
   • Added instructions for generating and viewing the documentation
   • Provided details about API versioning, authentication, and error 
handling

6. Integration with MACH Architecture:
   • Updated the FEATURE-002-IMPLEMENTATION.md file to include API 
documentation details
   • Ensured alignment with the API-first principle of the MACH architecture
   • Documented the relationship between the APIs and the microservices

This implementation provides a comprehensive API reference documentation that
supports the API-first approach of the MACH architecture, making it easy for
developers to understand and use the APIs.
