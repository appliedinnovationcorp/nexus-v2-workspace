Looking at the current implementation of Feature 002: Full MACH architecture, I can see that while the
ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) has been referenced in the documentation and included in 
the deployment script, the detailed configuration files for the ELK Stack components haven't been 
fully implemented in the codebase yet.

Here's what has been implemented regarding the ELK Stack:

1. Deployment Script:
   • The ELK Stack components are included in the 
/home/oss/Business/workspaces/nexus-v2-workspace/src/aic-website/infrastructure/helm/deploy-core.sh 
script with placeholders for Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Logstash values files.

2. Documentation:
   • The ELK Stack is mentioned in the architecture documentation as part of the observability stack.
   • It's listed as a component in the FEATURE-002-IMPLEMENTATION.md file.

3. Integration Points:
   • Kuma is configured to send logs to Elasticsearch in the mesh.yaml file.
   • Grafana is configured with Elasticsearch as a data source in the prometheus-values.yaml file.

However, the actual configuration files for the ELK Stack components (elasticsearch-values.yaml, 
kibana-values.yaml, logstash-values.yaml) haven't been created yet. These files would contain the 
detailed configuration for each component, including resource allocations, persistence settings, 
security configurations, and integration points.

To complete the ELK Stack implementation, we would need to create these configuration files and ensure
proper integration with the other components of the observability stack.
