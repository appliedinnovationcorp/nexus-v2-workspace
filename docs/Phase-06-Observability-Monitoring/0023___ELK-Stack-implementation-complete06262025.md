The ELK Stack implementation is now complete. Here's a summary of what
has been implemented:

1. Elasticsearch Configuration:
   • Created elasticsearch-values.yaml with detailed configuration for
high availability and security
   • Set up persistent storage using Longhorn
   • Configured resource limits and security settings
   • Added Prometheus metrics integration
   • Set up TLS encryption and authentication

2. Kibana Configuration:
   • Created kibana-values.yaml with configuration for visualization 
and user interface
   • Set up integration with Elasticsearch
   • Configured ingress for external access
   • Added security settings and encryption
   • Set up persistent storage for saved objects

3. Logstash Configuration:
   • Created logstash-values.yaml with pipeline configuration for log 
processing
   • Set up multiple input plugins (HTTP, TCP, Beats, Kafka)
   • Configured custom filtering and processing logic
   • Added output to Elasticsearch
   • Set up persistent queue for reliability

4. Integration Components:
   • Created logstash-patterns-configmap.yaml with custom log parsing 
patterns
   • Set up elk-secrets.yaml for secure credential management
   • Created Kibana dashboards for monitoring different components
   • Added scripts for deployment and integration

5. Deployment and Integration Scripts:
   • Created deploy-elk.sh for deploying the ELK Stack
   • Added import-dashboards.sh for importing Kibana dashboards
   • Created integrate-elk.sh for integrating with other components
   • Added comprehensive documentation in README.md

6. Integration with Other Components:
   • Set up Kong plugin for sending logs to ELK
   • Configured Kuma to send service mesh logs to ELK
   • Created Prometheus ServiceMonitors for monitoring ELK components
   • Added Grafana dashboard for ELK monitoring

This implementation provides a comprehensive centralized logging 
solution for the MACH architecture, allowing for the collection, 
processing, storage, and visualization of logs from all components of 
the system.
