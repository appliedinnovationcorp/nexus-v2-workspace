Looking at the current implementation of Feature 002: Full MACH architecture, I can see that Jaeger 
for distributed tracing has been referenced in the documentation and included in the deployment 
script, but the detailed configuration for Jaeger hasn't been fully implemented in the codebase yet.

Here's what has been implemented regarding Jaeger:

1. Deployment Script:
   • Jaeger is included in the 
/home/oss/Business/workspaces/nexus-v2-workspace/src/aic-website/infrastructure/helm/deploy-core.sh 
script with a placeholder for the jaeger-values.yaml file.

2. Documentation:
   • Jaeger is mentioned in the architecture documentation as part of the observability stack.
   • It's listed as a component in the FEATURE-002-IMPLEMENTATION.md file.

3. Integration Points:
   • Kuma is configured to send traces to Zipkin (which Jaeger can collect) in the kuma-values.yaml 
file.
   • Grafana is configured with Jaeger as a data source in the prometheus-values.yaml file.

4. Docker Compose:
   • Zipkin (which is compatible with Jaeger) is included in the Docker Compose file for local 
development.

However, the actual configuration file for Jaeger (jaeger-values.yaml) hasn't been created yet. This 
file would contain the detailed configuration for Jaeger, including storage settings, sampling 
strategies, UI configuration, and resource allocations.

To complete the Jaeger implementation, we would need to create this configuration file and ensure 
proper integration with the other components of the observability stack, particularly with the service
mesh and API gateway for trace generation.
