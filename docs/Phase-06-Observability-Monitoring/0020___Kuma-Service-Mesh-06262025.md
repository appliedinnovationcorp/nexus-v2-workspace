the Kuma Service Mesh has been set up in this codebase as part of the 
Feature 002: Full MACH implementation. Here's what has been implemented for Kuma:

1. Kuma Configuration Files:
   • Created Kuma mesh configuration at 
/home/oss/Business/workspaces/nexus-v2-workspace/src/aic-website/apps/api-gateway/kuma/mesh.yaml
   • Added traffic routing policies at 
/home/oss/Business/workspaces/nexus-v2-workspace/src/aic-website/apps/api-gateway/kuma/traffic-route.yaml
   • Set up traffic permissions at 
/home/oss/Business/workspaces/nexus-v2-workspace/src/aic-website/apps/api-gateway/kuma/traffic-permission.yaml
   • Configured traffic logging at 
/home/oss/Business/workspaces/nexus-v2-workspace/src/aic-website/apps/api-gateway/kuma/traffic-log.yaml
   • Added health checks at 
/home/oss/Business/workspaces/nexus-v2-workspace/src/aic-website/apps/api-gateway/kuma/health-check.yaml

2. Helm Deployment:
   • Created Helm values for Kuma at 
/home/oss/Business/workspaces/nexus-v2-workspace/src/aic-website/infrastructure/helm/kuma-values.yaml
   • Added Kuma deployment to the core components script at 
/home/oss/Business/workspaces/nexus-v2-workspace/src/aic-website/infrastructure/helm/deploy-core.sh

3. Docker Compose:
   • Included Kuma control plane in the Docker Compose file at 
/home/oss/Business/workspaces/nexus-v2-workspace/src/aic-website/apps/api-gateway/docker-compose.yaml

4. Service Annotations:
   • Added Kuma annotations to service deployments in Kubernetes manifests (e.g.,
kuma.io/mesh: default)

The Kuma Service Mesh implementation provides:
• mTLS between all services
• Traffic management and routing
• Health checks and circuit breaking
• Observability with metrics, logging, and tracing
• Service discovery

The service mesh is integrated with Kong API Gateway to provide a complete API 
management and service communication solution.
