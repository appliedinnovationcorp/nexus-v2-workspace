ArgoCD for GitOps has been configured in this codebase as part of the CI/CD pipeline 
implementation. Here's what has been implemented for ArgoCD:

1. ArgoCD Configuration Files:
   • Created ArgoCD values file at 
/home/oss/Business/workspaces/nexus-v2-workspace/src/aic-website/infrastructure/argocd/argocd-values.yaml
   • This file includes configuration for:
     • Server replicas and resources
     • Ingress settings with Kong integration
     • OIDC integration with Keycloak
     • Repository credentials
     • RBAC policies

2. ArgoCD Application Manifests:
   • Created application manifests in the 
/home/oss/Business/workspaces/nexus-v2-workspace/src/aic-website/infrastructure/argocd/applications/ 
directory:
     • backend-services.yaml for backend microservices
     • ai-services.yaml for AI-related services
     • ghost-cms.yaml for the CMS

3. Setup Script:
   • Created a setup script at 
/home/oss/Business/workspaces/nexus-v2-workspace/src/aic-website/infrastructure/argocd/setup-argocd.sh
   • This script:
     • Creates the ArgoCD namespace
     • Installs ArgoCD using Helm
     • Retrieves the admin password
     • Applies the application manifests

4. Integration with CI/CD Pipeline:
   • The Jenkins pipeline includes steps to interact with ArgoCD
   • GitLab CI triggers Jenkins, which updates the GitOps repository and syncs ArgoCD

The ArgoCD configuration follows GitOps principles, using Git as the single source of truth for the 
desired state of the infrastructure and applications. The setup enables continuous deployment with 
automated synchronization from Git repositories to Kubernetes clusters.
