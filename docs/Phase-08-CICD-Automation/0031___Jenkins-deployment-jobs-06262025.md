Jenkins deployment jobs have been implemented in this codebase as part of the CI/CD pipeline. 
Specifically, a Jenkinsfile has been created at:

/home/oss/Business/workspaces/nexus-v2-workspace/src/aic-website/infrastructure/cicd/jenkins/Jenkinsfile

This Jenkinsfile defines a comprehensive deployment pipeline with the following features:

1. Kubernetes Agent Configuration:
   • Uses a Kubernetes pod with multiple containers (kubectl, helm, argocd)
   • Ensures all necessary tools are available for deployment

2. Parameterized Pipeline:
   • Accepts parameters like IMAGE_TAG and ENVIRONMENT
   • Supports different deployment environments (dev, staging, production)

3. Deployment Stages:
   • **Validate Parameters**: Ensures required parameters are provided
   • **Configure Kubernetes**: Sets up kubectl with the appropriate kubeconfig
   • **Update Helm Values**: Updates the image tag in the GitOps repository
   • **Deploy with ArgoCD**: Triggers ArgoCD to sync the application
   • **Verify Deployment**: Confirms the deployment was successful

4. Integration with GitOps:
   • Clones the GitOps repository
   • Updates the values file with the new image tag
   • Commits and pushes changes to trigger ArgoCD

5. Notifications:
   • Sends Slack notifications on success or failure
   • Includes deployment details and environment information

This Jenkins pipeline represents the final stage in the hybrid CI/CD strategy, where Jenkins handles 
the complex deployment orchestration after GitHub Actions has built the code and GitLab CI has 
performed security scanning and compliance checks.
