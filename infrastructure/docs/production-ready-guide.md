## Overview

The AIC Enterprise Platform infrastructure has been designed with production-readiness in mind, focusing on reliability, security, scalability, and observability. This document outlines the key components and configurations that make our infrastructure production-ready.

## Production-Ready Configurations

### Environment-Specific Configurations

We maintain separate configurations for each environment (development, staging, production) to ensure proper isolation and appropriate resource allocation:

- **Development**: Optimized for developer productivity with minimal resource allocation
- **Staging**: Mirrors production configuration with reduced resource allocation
- **Production**: Full resource allocation with high availability and redundancy

Configuration files are stored in `/infrastructure/environments/` with environment-specific settings.

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

All infrastructure is defined as code using Terraform, enabling:

- Version-controlled infrastructure changes
- Consistent deployments across environments
- Automated provisioning and scaling
- Multi-cloud deployment support (AWS, Azure, GCP)

### Network Architecture

The production network architecture includes:

- VPC with public and private subnets
- NAT gateways for outbound connectivity
- Network security groups and ACLs
- Load balancers with SSL termination
- CDN integration for static assets

### Database Configuration

PostgreSQL is configured for production with:

- High availability with primary and replica nodes
- Automated backups and point-in-time recovery
- Connection pooling
- Performance optimization
- Encryption at rest and in transit

### Caching Layer

Redis is configured for production with:

- Cluster mode for high availability
- Sentinel for automatic failover
- Persistence enabled
- Encryption and authentication
- Memory optimization

## Secrets Management

We've implemented a comprehensive secrets management solution that addresses previous weaknesses:

### External Secrets Operator

The External Secrets Operator integrates Kubernetes with external secret management systems:

```yaml
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
kind: SecretStore
metadata:
  name: aws-secrets-manager
  namespace: aic-platform
spec:
  provider:
    aws:
      service: SecretsManager
      region: us-east-1
      auth:
        jwt:
          serviceAccountRef:
            name: external-secrets-sa
```

### Multi-Provider Support

Our secrets management solution supports multiple cloud providers:

- **AWS**: AWS Secrets Manager
- **Azure**: Azure Key Vault
- **GCP**: Google Secret Manager
- **On-premises**: HashiCorp Vault

### Secret Rotation

Automated secret rotation is configured for sensitive credentials:

- Database credentials: Every 30 days
- API keys: Every 90 days
- JWT tokens: Every 7 days

### Secrets Management CLI

A dedicated CLI tool (`secrets-management.sh`) provides a unified interface for managing secrets across environments and providers.

## Kubernetes Resource Management

We've implemented proper resource management in Kubernetes to ensure stability and efficiency:

### Resource Quotas

Namespace-level resource quotas prevent resource exhaustion:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: aic-platform-quota
  namespace: aic-platform
spec:
  hard:
    requests.cpu: "50"
    requests.memory: 100Gi
    limits.cpu: "100"
    limits.memory: 200Gi
    persistentvolumeclaims: "20"
    services: "20"
    secrets: "50"
    configmaps: "50"
    pods: "100"
```

### Resource Limits

All containers have appropriate resource requests and limits:

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "500m"
    memory: "1Gi"
    ephemeral-storage: "1Gi"
  limits:
    cpu: "2"
    memory: "4Gi"
    ephemeral-storage: "5Gi"
```

### Horizontal Pod Autoscaling

HPA is configured for automatic scaling based on CPU and memory metrics:

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: aic-website-hpa
  namespace: aic-platform
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: aic-website
  minReplicas: 3
  maxReplicas: 20
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 70
```

### Pod Disruption Budgets

PDBs ensure high availability during cluster operations:

```yaml
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: aic-website-pdb
  namespace: aic-platform
spec:
  minAvailable: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: aic-website
```

## High Availability

Our infrastructure is designed for high availability at all levels:

### Multi-AZ Deployment

- Kubernetes nodes distributed across multiple availability zones
- Database and Redis replicas in separate availability zones
- Load balancers with cross-zone load balancing

### Redundancy

- Minimum of 3 replicas for critical services
- Database read replicas for load distribution
- Redis sentinel for automatic failover

### Graceful Degradation

- Circuit breakers for external dependencies
- Fallback mechanisms for non-critical features
- Caching strategies to handle service disruptions

## Security

Comprehensive security measures are implemented:

### Network Security

- Default deny network policies
- Segmented network architecture
- Ingress and egress controls
- TLS for all communications

### Pod Security

- Non-root containers
- Read-only file systems
- Dropped capabilities
- Security context constraints

```yaml
securityContext:
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsUser: 1001
  capabilities:
    drop:
    - ALL
```

### Authentication and Authorization
