# Feature 002: Full MACH

## Description
Implement a full MACH (Microservices, API-first, Cloud-native, 
Headless) architecture with Kong and Kuma. Container Orchestration provided by kubernetes (manages microservices lifecycle) and Docker (containerization). Data Layer uses PostgreSQL for transactional data, Redis for caching and sessions, Elasticsearch for search capabilities, and Apache Kafka for Message queues and async communication. Observability Stack comprised of Prometheus + Grafana for metrics and dashboards, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging, Jaeger for distributed tracing, and AlertManager for alerting
Hybrid CI/CD Pipeline Strategy
    - Hybrid CI/CD Strategy:
        GitHub Actions for:
        • Source code triggers and lightweight builds
        • Pull request validation and testing
        • Container image building and pushing
        • Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) deployments

        GitLab CI for:
        • Centralized pipeline orchestration
        • Security scanning and compliance checks
        • Container registry and artifact management
        • Cross-repository coordination

        Jenkins for:
        • Complex deployment orchestrations
        • Legacy system integrations
        • Custom plugin requirements
        • On-premises deployment tasks

        Example Workflow:
        1. GitHub Actions - Triggered on code push, runs tests, builds 
        containers
        2. GitLab CI - Orchestrates security scans, manages artifacts, 
        coordinates releases
        3. Jenkins - Handles complex deployments to Kong/Kuma infrastructure

        Coordination methods:
        • Webhook triggers between platforms
        • Shared artifact repositories
        • Common deployment targets (Kubernetes)
        • Unified monitoring and notifications

ArgoCD for GitOps deployments.
Harbor for container registry.
Security & Secrets: HashiCorp Vault for secrets management. OAuth2/OIDC provider Keycloak. Certificate management cert-manager for K8s.
Storage & Backup: Persistent volumes for stateful services: longhorn Cloud-native distributed block storage for Kubernetes.
OpenEBS - Container-attached storage.
Object storage MinIO S3-compatible object storage.
Database backup solutions: Velero for Kubernetes cluster backup and restore. Stash for Kubernetes backup operator.
Ceph for Distributed storage system.
Infrastructure as Code: Terraform for infrastructure provisioning. Helm charts for Kubernetes deployments.
Standard MACH additions: CDN CloudFlare. Event streaming platform Kafka. API documentation OpenAPI/Swagger.
