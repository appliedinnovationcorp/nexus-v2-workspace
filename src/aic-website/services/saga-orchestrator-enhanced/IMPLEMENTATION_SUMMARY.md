```bash
cd saga-orchestrator-enhanced
docker-compose up -d
```

### 2. Kubernetes (Production)
```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh --environment production --namespace saga-system
```

### 3. Manual Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m src.main
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `CLUSTER_ENABLED`: Enable clustering (true/false)
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `REDIS_URL`: Redis connection string
- `JWT_SECRET`: JWT signing secret
- `MAX_CONCURRENT_SAGAS`: Concurrency limit
