const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'What is MLOps and why is it important?',
    answer: 'MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) is the practice of applying DevOps principles to machine learning workflows. It\'s important because it enables organizations to deploy, monitor, and maintain ML models reliably at scale, reducing time-to-market and ensuring consistent model performance in production.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you assess MLOps maturity?',
    answer: 'We assess MLOps maturity across multiple dimensions including automation level, monitoring capabilities, governance processes, collaboration practices, and infrastructure scalability. We use established frameworks like Google\'s MLOps maturity model to provide objective assessments and improvement recommendations.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What are the key components of an MLOps platform?',
    answer: 'Key components include experiment tracking, model registry, automated training pipelines, model serving infrastructure, monitoring and observability, version control, automated testing, and governance frameworks. The specific components depend on your use cases and requirements.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does it take to implement MLOps?',
    answer: 'Implementation timelines vary based on current maturity, organizational size, and complexity. Basic MLOps setup can take 2-3 months, while comprehensive enterprise implementations may take 6-12 months. We provide phased approaches to deliver value incrementally.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you work with our existing ML tools and platforms?',
    answer: 'Yes, we specialize in working with existing tools and can integrate MLOps practices with your current technology stack. We assess your current setup and design solutions that enhance rather than replace your existing investments where possible.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you ensure model governance and compliance?',
    answer: 'We implement comprehensive governance frameworks including model documentation, audit trails, approval workflows, compliance checks, and automated reporting. We can customize governance processes to meet industry-specific regulations like FDA, GDPR, or financial services requirements.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What ROI can we expect from MLOps implementation?',
    answer: 'Organizations typically see 3-5x ROI from MLOps implementation through reduced deployment times, improved model reliability, decreased operational costs, and faster time-to-market. Specific ROI depends on your current processes and the scale of ML operations.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you provide ongoing MLOps support and optimization?',
    answer: 'Yes, we provide comprehensive ongoing support including platform maintenance, process optimization, team training, and continuous improvement. We can also provide managed MLOps services where we handle day-to-day operations while you focus on model development.'
