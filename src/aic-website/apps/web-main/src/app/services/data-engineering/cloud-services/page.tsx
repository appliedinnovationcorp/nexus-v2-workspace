const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'What are the benefits of cloud data engineering over on-premises?',
    answer: 'Cloud data engineering offers scalability, cost efficiency, reduced maintenance, faster deployment, built-in security, disaster recovery, and access to managed services. You pay only for what you use and can scale resources up or down based on demand, while cloud providers handle infrastructure maintenance and updates.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Which cloud platform is best for data engineering?',
    answer: 'The best platform depends on your specific needs, existing infrastructure, and requirements. AWS offers the most comprehensive data services, Google Cloud excels in analytics and ML, while Azure integrates well with Microsoft ecosystems. We can help assess your needs and recommend the optimal platform or multi-cloud approach.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you handle data security in the cloud?',
    answer: 'We implement comprehensive security measures including encryption at rest and in transit, identity and access management, network security, audit logging, and compliance frameworks. We follow cloud security best practices and can implement industry-specific compliance requirements like HIPAA, PCI-DSS, or GDPR.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the typical cost of cloud data engineering projects?',
    answer: 'Costs vary based on data volume, processing requirements, and complexity. Cloud solutions often reduce total cost of ownership by 30-50% compared to on-premises infrastructure. We provide detailed cost analysis and optimization strategies to ensure you get maximum value from your cloud investment.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does cloud migration take?',
    answer: 'Migration timelines depend on data volume, complexity, and requirements. Simple migrations might take 2-3 months, while complex enterprise migrations can take 6-12 months. We use phased approaches to minimize disruption and deliver value incrementally throughout the migration process.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you implement multi-cloud or hybrid solutions?',
    answer: 'Yes, we specialize in multi-cloud and hybrid architectures that leverage the best services from each provider while avoiding vendor lock-in. We can design solutions that span multiple clouds or integrate cloud services with on-premises infrastructure based on your requirements.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you ensure high availability and disaster recovery?',
    answer: 'We design resilient architectures with redundancy across multiple availability zones or regions, implement automated backup and recovery procedures, and establish monitoring and alerting systems. We can achieve 99.9%+ uptime with proper architecture and disaster recovery planning.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you provide ongoing cloud infrastructure management?',
    answer: 'Yes, we offer managed services including infrastructure monitoring, performance optimization, cost management, security updates, and 24/7 support. We can provide different levels of managed services based on your needs and internal capabilities.'
