const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'What is an AI agent and how is it different from regular AI?',
    answer: 'An AI agent is an autonomous system that can perceive its environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. Unlike regular AI that processes inputs and provides outputs, agents can operate independently, learn from interactions, and adapt their behavior over time.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What types of AI agents can you develop?',
    answer: 'We develop various types of AI agents including conversational agents (chatbots), task automation agents, decision-making agents, data analysis agents, multi-agent systems, and specialized domain agents for industries like finance, healthcare, and e-commerce.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do AI agents learn and improve over time?',
    answer: 'AI agents use various learning mechanisms including reinforcement learning, supervised learning from feedback, and continuous training on new data. They can adapt their behavior based on user interactions, environmental changes, and performance feedback.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can AI agents work together in teams?',
    answer: 'Yes, we specialize in multi-agent systems where multiple AI agents collaborate to solve complex problems. These agents can communicate, coordinate tasks, share information, and work together more effectively than individual agents.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you ensure AI agents make reliable decisions?',
    answer: 'We implement multiple safeguards including decision validation, confidence scoring, human oversight mechanisms, fallback procedures, and continuous monitoring. Agents are designed with clear boundaries and escalation protocols for uncertain situations.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What level of autonomy can AI agents have?',
    answer: 'Agent autonomy levels can range from fully supervised (requiring human approval for all actions) to fully autonomous (operating independently within defined parameters). We design the appropriate level based on your risk tolerance and use case requirements.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you integrate AI agents with existing systems?',
    answer: 'We integrate agents through APIs, webhooks, database connections, and custom connectors. Our agents can work with CRM systems, databases, cloud services, IoT devices, and virtually any system with an accessible interface.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What industries benefit most from AI agents?',
    answer: 'AI agents are valuable across many industries including customer service, finance, healthcare, e-commerce, manufacturing, logistics, and telecommunications. Any industry with repetitive tasks, decision-making processes, or customer interactions can benefit from AI agents.'
