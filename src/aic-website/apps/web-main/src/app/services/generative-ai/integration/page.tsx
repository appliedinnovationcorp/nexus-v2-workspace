const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'What types of systems can you integrate with AI?',
    answer: 'We can integrate AI with virtually any system that has an API or database connection, including CRM systems, ERP platforms, e-commerce sites, mobile apps, web applications, databases, cloud services, and legacy systems. Our integration approach is flexible and adaptable to your existing infrastructure.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does AI integration typically take?',
    answer: 'Integration timelines vary based on complexity and scope. Simple API integrations can be completed in 1-2 weeks, while complex enterprise integrations may take 2-6 months. We provide detailed project timelines during the planning phase based on your specific requirements.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you work with existing AI models or only new ones?',
    answer: 'We work with both existing AI models (like OpenAI GPT, Google AI, Anthropic Claude) and custom models. Our integration services can connect any AI model or service to your systems, whether it\'s a third-party API or a custom model you\'ve developed.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you ensure data security during integration?',
    answer: 'We implement comprehensive security measures including data encryption in transit and at rest, secure authentication protocols, access controls, audit logging, and compliance with relevant regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2). Security is built into every aspect of our integration process.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you integrate AI with legacy systems?',
    answer: 'Yes, we specialize in integrating modern AI capabilities with legacy systems. We use various approaches including API wrappers, database connectors, file-based integration, and middleware solutions to bridge the gap between old and new technologies.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens if the AI service goes down or changes?',
    answer: 'We build resilient integrations with fallback mechanisms, error handling, retry logic, and alternative service options. We also provide monitoring and alerting systems to quickly identify and resolve any issues. Our integrations are designed to be robust and maintainable.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you handle API rate limits and costs?',
    answer: 'We implement intelligent rate limiting, request queuing, caching strategies, and cost optimization techniques. We monitor usage patterns and provide recommendations for cost-effective AI service usage while maintaining performance requirements.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you provide ongoing support after integration?',
    answer: 'Yes, we provide comprehensive ongoing support including monitoring, maintenance, updates, troubleshooting, and optimization. We also offer training for your team and can provide different levels of support based on your needs and budget.'
