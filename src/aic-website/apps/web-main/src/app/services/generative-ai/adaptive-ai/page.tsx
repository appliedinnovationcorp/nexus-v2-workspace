const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'What makes AI "adaptive" compared to traditional AI?',
    answer: 'Adaptive AI systems can learn and improve continuously from new data and experiences, automatically adjusting their behavior without manual retraining. Traditional AI models are static after training, while adaptive AI evolves and optimizes itself over time based on real-world feedback and changing conditions.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How quickly can adaptive AI systems learn and adapt?',
    answer: 'Adaptation speed varies by use case and implementation. Some systems can adapt in real-time (milliseconds to seconds), while others may adapt over hours, days, or weeks. We design adaptation rates based on your specific requirements, balancing speed with stability and accuracy.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What types of businesses benefit most from adaptive AI?',
    answer: 'Businesses with dynamic environments benefit most, including e-commerce (changing customer preferences), finance (evolving fraud patterns), content platforms (shifting user interests), manufacturing (varying conditions), and any industry where conditions change frequently and require continuous optimization.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you prevent adaptive AI from learning bad behaviors?',
    answer: 'We implement multiple safeguards including reward shaping, constraint-based learning, human feedback integration, safety bounds, rollback mechanisms, and continuous monitoring. These ensure the AI learns beneficial behaviors while avoiding harmful or undesired adaptations.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can adaptive AI work with existing systems?',
    answer: 'Yes, we design adaptive AI to integrate seamlessly with existing systems through APIs, data pipelines, and feedback mechanisms. The adaptive components can enhance your current systems without requiring complete replacement of existing infrastructure.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you measure the success of adaptive AI systems?',
    answer: 'We track multiple metrics including adaptation speed, performance improvement over time, stability measures, user satisfaction, business KPIs, and learning efficiency. We establish baseline performance and continuously monitor improvement trajectories.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What data is needed for adaptive AI systems?',
    answer: 'Adaptive AI needs continuous data streams including user interactions, system performance metrics, environmental conditions, and feedback signals. The specific data requirements depend on what the system needs to adapt to - we help identify and implement the necessary data collection mechanisms.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you handle privacy concerns with adaptive learning?',
    answer: 'We implement privacy-preserving techniques including federated learning, differential privacy, data anonymization, and local learning approaches. These allow systems to adapt and learn while protecting individual privacy and sensitive information.'
