const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'What types of generative AI models can you develop?',
    answer: 'We develop various types of generative AI models including large language models (LLMs), image generation models, audio synthesis models, code generation systems, and multi-modal AI systems. Our expertise covers both training from scratch and fine-tuning existing models for specific use cases.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does it take to develop a custom AI model?',
    answer: 'Development timelines vary based on complexity and requirements. Simple fine-tuning projects may take 2-4 weeks, while custom model development from scratch can take 3-6 months. We provide detailed timelines during the planning phase based on your specific needs.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you work with existing AI models or only build from scratch?',
    answer: 'We work with both approaches. Often, fine-tuning existing pre-trained models like GPT, BERT, or Stable Diffusion is more cost-effective and faster. However, for highly specialized use cases, we can develop custom models from the ground up.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What kind of data do you need for AI model development?',
    answer: 'Data requirements depend on the specific use case. Generally, we need high-quality, relevant datasets that represent your target domain. We can help with data collection, cleaning, and augmentation. For fine-tuning, smaller datasets (thousands of examples) may suffice, while training from scratch requires larger datasets.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you ensure AI model performance and reliability?',
    answer: 'We implement comprehensive testing and validation processes including cross-validation, A/B testing, performance benchmarking, and continuous monitoring. We also implement safeguards, bias detection, and quality control measures to ensure reliable and ethical AI systems.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you integrate AI models with existing systems?',
    answer: 'Yes, we specialize in seamless integration with existing systems through APIs, SDKs, and custom connectors. We ensure minimal disruption to your current workflows while maximizing the benefits of AI integration.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What ongoing support do you provide after deployment?',
    answer: 'We provide comprehensive post-deployment support including performance monitoring, model updates, bug fixes, scaling assistance, and continuous optimization. We also offer training for your team and documentation for long-term maintenance.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you handle data privacy and security?',
    answer: 'Data privacy and security are paramount in our development process. We implement encryption, secure data handling practices, compliance with regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.), and can work with on-premises or private cloud deployments as needed.'
