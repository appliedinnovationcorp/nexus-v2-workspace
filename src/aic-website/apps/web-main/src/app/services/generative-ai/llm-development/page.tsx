const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'What is the difference between building a custom LLM and fine-tuning?',
    answer: 'Building a custom LLM involves training a model from scratch on your data, giving you complete control but requiring significant resources. Fine-tuning adapts an existing pre-trained model to your specific use case, which is faster and more cost-effective while still achieving excellent results for most applications.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How much data do I need to develop a custom LLM?',
    answer: 'Data requirements vary significantly based on the approach. For fine-tuning, you might need thousands to millions of examples depending on the task. For training from scratch, you typically need billions of tokens. We can help assess your data needs and suggest data augmentation strategies if needed.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What are the costs involved in LLM development?',
    answer: 'Costs depend on model size, training approach, and infrastructure needs. Fine-tuning projects typically range from $10K-$100K, while custom LLM development can range from $100K-$1M+. We provide detailed cost estimates based on your specific requirements and can suggest cost-optimization strategies.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does it take to develop a custom LLM?',
    answer: 'Fine-tuning projects typically take 2-8 weeks, while custom LLM development can take 3-12 months depending on complexity. Factors include data preparation time, model size, training requirements, and evaluation needs. We provide realistic timelines during the planning phase.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you help with model deployment and scaling?',
    answer: 'Yes, we provide end-to-end services including model optimization for deployment, infrastructure setup, API development, scaling solutions, and ongoing maintenance. We ensure your LLM performs efficiently in production environments.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you ensure LLM safety and prevent harmful outputs?',
    answer: 'We implement multiple safety measures including content filtering, bias testing, adversarial testing, human feedback training, and safety alignment techniques. We also provide monitoring tools to detect and prevent harmful outputs in production.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can LLMs work with proprietary or sensitive data?',
    answer: 'Yes, we can develop LLMs that work with proprietary data while maintaining security and privacy. Options include on-premises deployment, private cloud solutions, data encryption, and federated learning approaches that keep sensitive data secure.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What ongoing support do you provide for LLMs?',
    answer: 'We provide comprehensive ongoing support including performance monitoring, model updates, retraining with new data, bug fixes, scaling assistance, and technical support. We also offer training for your team to manage and maintain the models.'
