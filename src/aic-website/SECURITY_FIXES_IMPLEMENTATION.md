# Security Fixes Implementation Report

## Overview
This document outlines the critical security vulnerabilities that were identified and fixed across the AIC Website platform codebase.

## Critical Security Issues Fixed

### 1. Hardcoded Secrets and Weak Defaults ❌ → ✅

**Issue**: Production code contained hardcoded default secrets and weak fallback values.

**Files Fixed**:
- `.env.example` - Updated with secure placeholder values
- `.env.local` - Updated with development-only warnings
- `apps/backend/src/auth/keycloak-config.js` - Removed hardcoded fallbacks
- All authentication middleware files - Added secret validation

**Changes Made**:
- Removed all hardcoded secret fallbacks
- Added environment variable validation
- Added secret strength validation (minimum 32 characters)
- Added detection of common weak secrets
- Added clear warnings about development-only values

**Security Impact**: 
- Prevents accidental use of weak secrets in production
- Forces developers to set strong secrets explicitly
- Eliminates risk of default credentials being used

### 2. CORS Configuration Allowing All Origins ❌ → ✅

**Issue**: CORS was configured to allow all origins in production, creating security vulnerabilities.

**Files Fixed**:
- `apps/backend/src/index.ts` - Implemented environment-specific CORS origins

**Changes Made**:
- Environment-specific origin allowlists
- Dynamic origin validation function
- Proper error handling for blocked origins
- Support for custom origins via environment variables
- Restricted methods and headers
- Added CORS preflight caching

**Security Impact**:
- Prevents cross-origin attacks from unauthorized domains
- Maintains functionality for legitimate origins
- Provides flexibility for different environments

### 3. Missing Rate Limiting on Authentication Endpoints ❌ → ✅

**Issue**: No rate limiting was implemented on authentication endpoints, allowing brute force attacks.

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `apps/backend/src/middleware/rate-limiter.ts` - Comprehensive rate limiting middleware
- `services/user-service/src/routes/auth-routes.js` - Applied rate limiting to auth routes
- `apps/backend/src/index.ts` - Added global rate limiting

**Rate Limiting Implemented**:
- **Authentication endpoints**: 5 requests per 15 minutes
- **Password reset**: 3 requests per hour
- **Registration**: 3 requests per hour
- **File uploads**: 10 requests per hour
- **Contact forms**: 5 requests per hour
- **Global API**: 1000 requests per 15 minutes
- **Authenticated users**: 500 requests per 15 minutes (higher limits)

**Security Impact**:
- Prevents brute force attacks on login endpoints
- Mitigates password reset abuse
- Protects against registration spam
- Maintains service availability under attack

### 4. JWT Secret Validation ❌ → ✅

**Issue**: JWT secrets were used directly from environment variables without validation.

**Files Fixed**:
- All authentication middleware files across services
- Added comprehensive secret validation

**Changes Made**:
- Mandatory JWT_SECRET environment variable
- Minimum 32-character length requirement
- Detection and rejection of common weak secrets
- Runtime validation on application startup
- Clear error messages for developers

**Security Impact**:
- Ensures JWT tokens are cryptographically secure
- Prevents use of weak or default secrets
- Provides early detection of configuration issues

## Implementation Details

### Environment Variable Requirements

The following environment variables are now **REQUIRED** and must be set with strong values:

```bash
# Authentication & Security (REQUIRED)
JWT_SECRET="<generate-with-openssl-rand-base64-32>"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="<generate-with-openssl-rand-base64-32>"

# Keycloak Configuration (REQUIRED)
KEYCLOAK_URL="https://your-keycloak-instance.com"
KEYCLOAK_REALM="your-realm"
KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id"
KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret"
KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_USER="your-admin-user"
KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD="your-admin-password"

# CORS Configuration (OPTIONAL)
CORS_ORIGINS="https://additional-domain.com,https://another-domain.com"

# Redis for Rate Limiting (OPTIONAL - defaults to localhost)
REDIS_HOST="your-redis-host"
REDIS_PORT="6379"
REDIS_PASSWORD="your-redis-password"
```

### Generating Secure Secrets

Use the following command to generate cryptographically secure secrets:

```bash
# Generate a 32-character base64 secret
openssl rand -base64 32

# Generate a 64-character hex secret
openssl rand -hex 32
```

### Rate Limiting Configuration

Rate limiting is implemented using Redis as the backing store. The system will fall back to in-memory storage if Redis is not available, but Redis is recommended for production deployments.

### CORS Configuration

CORS origins are now environment-specific:

- **Development**: localhost origins only
- **Staging**: staging subdomain origins
- **Production**: production domain origins only

Additional origins can be added via the `CORS_ORIGINS` environment variable.

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. Test Secret Validation

```bash
# This should fail with an error
export JWT_SECRET="weak"
npm start

# This should work
export JWT_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
npm start
```

### 2. Test Rate Limiting

```bash
# Test authentication rate limiting (should block after 5 attempts)
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3100/api/auth/login \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"wrong"}'
done
```

### 3. Test CORS

```bash
# This should be blocked (assuming not in allowed origins)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3100/api/test \
  -H "Origin: https://malicious-site.com" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production, ensure:

- [ ] All required environment variables are set with strong values
- [ ] JWT_SECRET is at least 32 characters and cryptographically random
- [ ] CORS origins are properly configured for your domains
- [ ] Redis is configured for rate limiting
- [ ] Rate limiting is tested and working
- [ ] All services restart successfully with new configuration

## Monitoring and Alerting

Consider implementing monitoring for:

- Rate limiting violations (high number of blocked requests)
- CORS violations (blocked cross-origin requests)
- Authentication failures (potential brute force attempts)
- Missing or weak environment variables

## Additional Security Recommendations

1. **Implement IP Whitelisting**: For admin endpoints, consider additional IP-based restrictions
2. **Add Request Signing**: For API-to-API communication, implement request signing
3. **Enable Security Headers**: Ensure all security headers are properly configured
4. **Regular Security Audits**: Schedule regular security reviews and penetration testing
5. **Dependency Scanning**: Implement automated vulnerability scanning for dependencies

## Conclusion

These security fixes address critical vulnerabilities that could have led to:
- Unauthorized access through weak authentication
- Cross-origin attacks from malicious websites  
- Brute force attacks on authentication endpoints
- Compromise of JWT token security

All fixes have been implemented with backward compatibility in mind, but **require proper environment variable configuration** before deployment to production.
