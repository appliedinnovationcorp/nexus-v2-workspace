# Zero-Trust Security Architecture for AIC Website

## Overview
Complete zero-trust security implementation for the AIC enterprise platform, ensuring "never trust, always verify" principles across all system components.

## Architecture Principles
- **Identity-Centric Security**: Every user, device, and service must be authenticated and authorized
- **Least Privilege Access**: Minimal access rights for all entities
- **Continuous Verification**: Real-time monitoring and validation of all access requests
- **Micro-Segmentation**: Network isolation at the application and service level
- **Encryption Everywhere**: End-to-end encryption for all data in transit and at rest

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed
- Multi-factor authentication (Supabase Auth + NextAuth)
- API gateway with unified access control
- Database security with PostgreSQL

### ðŸš§ In Progress
- Network micro-segmentation
- Device trust verification
- Behavioral analytics

### ðŸ“‹ Planned
- Software-defined perimeter (SDP)
- Risk-based access control
- Continuous compliance monitoring

## Components

### 1. Identity & Access Management (IAM)
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**
- **Privileged Access Management (PAM)**
- **Identity Federation**

### 2. Network Security
- **Micro-Segmentation**
- **Software-Defined Perimeter (SDP)**
- **Zero-Trust Network Access (ZTNA)**
- **DNS Security**

### 3. Device Security
- **Device Trust Verification**
- **Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR)**
- **Mobile Device Management (MDM)**
- **Certificate-Based Authentication**

### 4. Data Protection
- **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**
- **Encryption at Rest & in Transit**
- **Data Classification & Labeling**
- **Rights Management**

### 5. Application Security
- **Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP)**
- **API Security Gateway**
- **Container Security**
- **Serverless Security**

### 6. Analytics & Monitoring
- **User & Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)**
- **Security Information & Event Management (SIEM)**
- **Continuous Risk Assessment**
- **Threat Intelligence Integration**

## Integration with AIC Architecture

### Next.js Application Layer
```javascript
// Zero-trust middleware integration
import { zeroTrustMiddleware } from './zero-trust-security/middleware'

// Apply to all API routes
export default zeroTrustMiddleware({
  authentication: true,
  authorization: true,
  deviceTrust: true,
  riskAssessment: true
})
```

### Microservices Security
```javascript
// Service-to-service authentication
import { serviceAuth } from './zero-trust-security/service-auth'

// Mutual TLS for all service communication
const secureServiceCall = await serviceAuth.authenticatedRequest({
  service: 'content-service',
  endpoint: '/api/articles',
  certificate: process.env.SERVICE_CERT
})
```

### Database Security
```sql
-- Row-level security policies
CREATE POLICY user_data_access ON users
  FOR ALL TO authenticated_users
  USING (user_id = current_user_id());

-- Encryption at rest
ALTER TABLE sensitive_data 
  SET (encryption_key_id = 'aes-256-gcm');
```

## Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Implement device trust verification
- Deploy network micro-segmentation
- Enhance authentication with risk scoring

### Phase 2: Advanced Controls (Weeks 3-4)
- Software-defined perimeter deployment
- Behavioral analytics implementation
- Continuous compliance monitoring

### Phase 3: Optimization (Weeks 5-6)
- Performance tuning
- User experience optimization
- Security automation enhancement

## Compliance & Standards
- **NIST Zero Trust Architecture (SP 800-207)**
- **SOC 2 Type II**
- **ISO 27001/27002**
- **GDPR/CCPA Data Protection**
- **FedRAMP (if applicable)**

## Monitoring & Metrics
- Authentication success/failure rates
- Device trust scores
- Network segmentation effectiveness
- Data access patterns
- Risk score distributions
- Incident response times

## Cost Considerations
- **Initial Implementation**: $75K-$150K
- **Annual Operating Costs**: $25K-$50K
- **ROI**: 200-400% through reduced security incidents
- **Compliance Cost Savings**: $50K-$100K annually

## Next Steps
1. Complete zero-trust security module implementation
2. Integrate with existing performance optimization suite
3. Deploy in staging environment for testing
4. Gradual production rollout with monitoring
5. Continuous improvement based on threat landscape
