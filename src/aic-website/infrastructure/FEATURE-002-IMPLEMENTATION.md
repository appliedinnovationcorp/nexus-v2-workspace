# Feature 002: Full MACH Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of Feature 002: Full MACH (Microservices, API-first, Cloud-native, Headless) architecture for the AIC Website.

## Implementation Overview

The implementation follows the MACH principles:

### Microservices
- Backend services are decomposed into independent microservices
- Each service has its own database and bounded context
- Services communicate via well-defined APIs
- Kong API Gateway manages service-to-service communication

### API-First
- Kong API Gateway provides centralized API management
- All functionality is accessible via APIs
- RESTful API design principles are followed
- API versioning strategy is implemented

### Cloud-Native
- Kubernetes for container orchestration
- Docker for containerization
- Horizontal auto-scaling configured
- Cloud-agnostic deployment capability

### Headless
- Backend services decoupled from frontend presentation
- Multiple frontend clients can consume the same APIs
- Content management (Ghost CMS) separated from presentation
- API responses are format-agnostic (JSON)
