The OPA policies for the GitLab CI pipeline are now complete. Here's a summary of 
what has been implemented:

1. Policy Structure:
   • Created a comprehensive set of OPA policies organized by domain:
     • security.rego: Security policies for the CI/CD pipeline
     • compliance.rego: Compliance policies for the CI/CD pipeline
     • deployment.rego: Deployment policies for the CI/CD pipeline
     • resource.rego: Resource constraint policies for the CI/CD pipeline
     • access.rego: Access control policies for the CI/CD pipeline
     • common.rego: Common utility functions shared across policies

2. Security Policies:
   • Required security jobs (SAST, dependency scanning, secret detection)
   • Valid image references from approved registries
   • Restrictions on privileged jobs
   • Protection against sensitive data in variables
   • Valid deployment targets based on branch

3. Compliance Policies:
   • Required compliance jobs for main branch
   • License scanning requirements
   • Accessibility check requirements for production deployments
   • Production change approval requirements
   • Branch protection rules

4. Deployment Policies:
   • Valid deployment sequence (dev → staging → production)
   • Required environment variables for deployments
   • Resource limits for Kubernetes deployments
   • Deployment schedule restrictions
   • Rollback strategy requirements

5. Resource Policies:
   • Limits on CPU and memory requests
   • Job timeout restrictions
   • Cache configuration validation
   • Artifact size and configuration validation
   • Service configuration validation

6. Access Policies:
   • User permission checks based on role
   • Protected variables access restrictions
   • Environment access controls
   • Runner access controls
   • Trigger access controls

7. Integration with GitLab CI:
   • Added policy validation jobs to the GitLab CI pipeline
   • Created a template for policy validation
   • Set up automated testing of policies
   • Implemented pipeline validation against policies

8. Documentation and Testing:
   • Created a comprehensive README explaining the OPA policies
   • Added a sample input file for testing
   • Created a script for testing policies locally
   • Added comments throughout the policies for better understanding

These OPA policies provide a robust governance framework for the GitLab CI 
pipeline, ensuring that all CI/CD activities adhere to security, compliance, and 
operational best practices.
