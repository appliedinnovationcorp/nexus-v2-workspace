# AIC Website Security Runbooks

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive security runbooks and incident response procedures for the AIC Website platform. These runbooks provide step-by-step guidance for handling security incidents, implementing security controls, and maintaining the security posture of the system.

## Security Architecture

The AIC Website implements a **Zero Trust Security** model with multiple layers of protection:

- **Network Security**: Service mesh with mTLS, network policies, and segmentation
- **Application Security**: Authentication, authorization, input validation, and secure coding
- **Infrastructure Security**: Container security, secrets management, and access controls
- **Data Security**: Encryption at rest and in transit, data classification, and privacy controls
- **Monitoring Security**: SIEM, threat detection, and security analytics

## Severity Classifications

### Critical (P0)
- Active data breach or exfiltration
- Complete system compromise
- Ransomware or destructive attacks
- Public-facing service compromise

### High (P1)
- Unauthorized access to sensitive data
- Privilege escalation attacks
- Malware detection in production
- DDoS attacks affecting availability

### Medium (P2)
- Suspicious activity requiring investigation
- Failed authentication attempts (brute force)
- Vulnerability exploitation attempts
- Policy violations

### Low (P3)
- Security configuration drift
- Non-critical vulnerability discoveries
- Security awareness violations
- Routine security events

## Quick Response Actions

### Immediate Response (First 15 minutes)
1. **Assess and classify** the incident severity
2. **Isolate affected systems** if necessary
3. **Notify security team** via emergency channels
4. **Begin evidence collection** and documentation
5. **Activate incident response team** for P0/P1 incidents

### Short-term Response (First hour)
1. **Contain the threat** and prevent spread
2. **Preserve evidence** for forensic analysis
3. **Notify stakeholders** according to severity
4. **Begin detailed investigation**
5. **Implement temporary mitigations**

### Recovery Phase
1. **Eradicate the threat** from all systems
2. **Restore services** from clean backups
3. **Implement permanent fixes**
4. **Monitor for recurring threats**
5. **Conduct post-incident review**
