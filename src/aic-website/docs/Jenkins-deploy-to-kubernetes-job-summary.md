The Jenkins deploy-to-kubernetes job is now complete. Here's a summary of what has
been implemented:

1. Jenkins Job Configurations:
   • Created comprehensive Jenkins job configurations using Job DSL:
     • aic-website-production-deploy.groovy: Main production deployment job
     • aic-website-rollback.groovy: Rollback job for reverting failed deployments
     • aic-website-database-migration.groovy: Database migration job
     • aic-website-smoke-test.groovy: Post-deployment smoke tests

2. Jenkins Configuration as Code:
   • Created a JCasC configuration file (jenkins.yaml) for declarative Jenkins 
setup
   • Configured security, credentials, plugins, and job definitions
   • Set up Kubernetes integration for dynamic agent provisioning

3. Kubernetes Integration:
   • Created Kubernetes manifests for deploying Jenkins in a Kubernetes cluster
   • Set up RBAC permissions for Jenkins to interact with Kubernetes
   • Configured persistent storage for Jenkins data
   • Set up ingress for external access

4. GitLab CI Integration:
   • Created a script to set up GitLab CI integration with Jenkins
   • Configured GitLab CI variables for Jenkins authentication
   • Set up webhooks for triggering Jenkins jobs from GitLab events

5. Deployment Pipeline:
   • Implemented a comprehensive deployment pipeline with:
     • Parameter validation
     • Approval workflows
     • GitOps repository updates
     • Kubernetes deployments
     • Canary deployments
     • Rollback mechanisms
     • Post-deployment verification

6. Database Migration Handling:
   • Created a dedicated job for database migrations
   • Implemented backup before migration
   • Added dry-run capability for testing migrations
   • Set up verification steps for successful migrations

7. Monitoring and Notifications:
   • Integrated with Slack for deployment notifications
   • Set up status reporting back to GitLab
   • Configured deployment tracking and history

8. Documentation:
   • Created a comprehensive README explaining the Jenkins integration
   • Documented the job configurations and their purposes
   • Provided setup instructions and usage guidelines

This implementation provides a robust Jenkins deployment pipeline that integrates 
with GitLab CI as part of the hybrid CI/CD approach defined in ADR-0007, focusing 
on complex deployment orchestration for production environments.
