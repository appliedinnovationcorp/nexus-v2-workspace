# [ADR-0010] Frontend Framework

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2023-07-15

## Context

As part of our MACH architecture implementation ([ADR-0001](0001-adopt-mach-architecture.md)), we need to select a frontend framework for our web application. The "Headless" aspect of MACH requires a decoupled frontend that consumes APIs from our backend services and CMS.

Our frontend requirements include:
- Performance and responsiveness
- Component-based architecture
- State management capabilities
- Routing for single-page application (SPA)
- Server-side rendering (SSR) for SEO and performance
- TypeScript support
- Testing framework integration
- Design system compatibility
- Developer experience and productivity
- Community support and ecosystem

## Decision

We will use **Next.js** with **React** as our frontend framework.

The frontend will be implemented with the following key technologies:
- Next.js as the React framework
- TypeScript for type safety
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- Styled Components for styling
- Jest and React Testing Library for testing
- Storybook for component documentation
- Vercel for hosting and deployment

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Performance**: Next.js provides excellent performance with SSR, static site generation (SSG), and incremental static regeneration (ISR).
- **SEO**: Server-side rendering improves SEO compared to client-side-only rendering.
- **Developer Experience**: Strong developer experience with hot reloading, TypeScript support, and good error messages.
- **Ecosystem**: Large ecosystem of libraries and tools compatible with React and Next.js.
- **Scalability**: Component-based architecture allows for scaling the application as it grows.
- **TypeScript Integration**: First-class TypeScript support for type safety.
- **API Routes**: Built-in API routes for backend functionality when needed.
- **Image Optimization**: Automatic image optimization for better performance.
- **Community Support**: Large and active community with regular updates and improvements.

### Negative

- **Learning Curve**: Team members unfamiliar with React and Next.js will need time to learn.
- **Build Complexity**: More complex build process compared to simpler frameworks.
- **Bundle Size**: Potential for large bundle sizes if not carefully managed.
- **Hydration Issues**: Potential for hydration mismatches between server and client rendering.
- **Opinionated Structure**: Next.js has opinions about project structure that may not align with all preferences.
- **Deployment Considerations**: Requires specific deployment setup for SSR functionality.

## Alternatives Considered

### Vue.js with Nuxt.js

**Pros**:
- Gentle learning curve
- Good documentation
- Similar features to Next.js (SSR, routing, etc.)
- Strong community
- Good TypeScript support

**Cons**:
- Smaller ecosystem compared to React
- Less adoption in enterprise applications
- Fewer third-party libraries
- Potentially slower performance in complex applications
- Less mature TypeScript integration historically

This option was strongly considered but rejected in favor of React/Next.js due to team familiarity and the larger ecosystem.

### Angular

**Pros**:
- Comprehensive framework with built-in features
- Strong TypeScript integration
- Good for large enterprise applications
- Enforced structure and patterns
- Robust tooling

**Cons**:
- Steeper learning curve
- More verbose compared to React
- Heavier bundle size
- Less flexibility
- Slower development velocity for small to medium projects

This option was rejected due to concerns about the learning curve and development velocity.

### Svelte with SvelteKit

**Pros**:
- Excellent performance
- Minimal boilerplate code
- Compile-time framework
- Built-in animations
- Growing community

**Cons**:
- Smaller ecosystem
- Fewer learning resources
- Less mature than React/Next.js
- Fewer experienced developers available
- Less enterprise adoption

This option was rejected due to concerns about ecosystem maturity and team familiarity, though it may be reconsidered for future projects.

### Single-Page Application (SPA) Only

**Pros**:
- Simpler architecture
- Easier deployment
- No server-side rendering complexity
- Full client-side control
- Potentially faster development for simple applications

**Cons**:
- SEO challenges
- Slower initial load times
- More client-side processing
- Potential accessibility issues
- Less optimal for content-heavy sites

This option was rejected due to SEO requirements and performance considerations for initial page loads.
