# [ADR-0006] Observability Stack

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2023-06-25

## Context

As part of our MACH architecture implementation ([ADR-0001](0001-adopt-mach-architecture.md)), we need a comprehensive observability stack to monitor and troubleshoot our distributed system. Observability is particularly important in a microservices architecture due to its distributed nature and the complexity of interactions between services.

Our observability requirements include:
- Metrics collection and visualization
- Distributed tracing
- Centralized logging
- Alerting and notification
- Service health monitoring
- Performance analysis
- Debugging capabilities
- Scalability to handle high volumes of telemetry data

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive observability stack consisting of:

1. **Prometheus and Grafana** for metrics collection and visualization:
   - Prometheus for metrics collection and storage
   - Grafana for metrics visualization and dashboards
   - AlertManager for alerting based on metrics

2. **ELK Stack** for centralized logging:
   - Elasticsearch for log storage and search
   - Logstash for log processing and transformation
   - Kibana for log visualization and analysis
   - Filebeat for log collection

3. **Jaeger** for distributed tracing:
   - Jaeger Collector for trace collection
   - Jaeger Query for trace storage and querying
   - Jaeger UI for trace visualization
   - OpenTelemetry for instrumentation

These components will be deployed in Kubernetes in the `observability` namespace using Helm charts, with appropriate resource allocations and persistence configuration.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Comprehensive Visibility**: Complete view of system behavior across metrics, logs, and traces.
- **Correlation**: Ability to correlate issues across different observability signals.
- **Proactive Monitoring**: Early detection of issues through alerting.
- **Performance Optimization**: Data-driven approach to performance optimization.
- **Debugging Efficiency**: Faster troubleshooting of issues in production.
- **Capacity Planning**: Better insights for capacity planning and scaling decisions.
- **Open Standards**: Based on open standards and open-source tools.
- **Kubernetes Integration**: Good integration with Kubernetes ecosystem.

### Negative

- **Resource Usage**: Observability stack requires significant resources.
- **Operational Complexity**: Multiple components to manage and maintain.
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn multiple tools and concepts.
- **Data Volume**: High volume of telemetry data to manage.
- **Configuration Effort**: Requires careful configuration for optimal performance.
- **Integration Work**: Needs integration with all services and infrastructure components.

## Alternatives Considered

### Cloud Provider Observability Solutions (AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, GCP Operations)

**Pros**:
- Fully managed services
- Tight integration with cloud provider infrastructure
- Reduced operational overhead
- Built-in scaling

**Cons**:
- Vendor lock-in
- Potentially higher costs at scale
- Limited customization
- Less control over data retention and processing

This option was rejected due to concerns about vendor lock-in and the desire for a cloud-agnostic solution.

### Commercial Observability Platforms (Datadog, New Relic, Dynatrace)

**Pros**:
- All-in-one solutions
- Advanced features and AI capabilities
- Reduced operational overhead
- Professional support

**Cons**:
- Subscription costs can be high at scale
- Potential vendor lock-in
- Data leaving our infrastructure
- Less control over implementation details

This option was rejected primarily due to cost concerns and the desire to maintain control over our observability data.

### Minimal Observability Stack (Prometheus + Loki)

**Pros**:
- Simpler to operate and maintain
- Lower resource requirements
- Focused feature set
- Lighter learning curve

**Cons**:
- Limited capabilities for complex troubleshooting
- Missing advanced features like distributed tracing
- May not scale as well for all use cases
- Less comprehensive visibility

This option was rejected because the benefits of a comprehensive observability stack outweigh the added complexity for our microservices architecture.

### OpenTelemetry Collector + Backends

**Pros**:
- Open standards-based approach
- Vendor-neutral
- Unified instrumentation
- Flexibility to change backends

**Cons**:
- Less mature ecosystem
- More integration work required
- Fewer out-of-the-box dashboards and alerts
- Potentially more complex initial setup

This option was partially accepted - we will use OpenTelemetry for instrumentation but with specific backends (Prometheus, ELK, Jaeger) rather than a pure OpenTelemetry approach.
