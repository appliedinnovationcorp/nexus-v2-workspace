# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the AIC Website project.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are documents that capture important architectural decisions made along with their context and consequences. Each ADR describes a single architectural decision.

## Why ADRs?

ADRs help us:
- Document architectural decisions and their rationale
- Provide context for future team members
- Track the evolution of the system architecture
- Make the decision process transparent and collaborative

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this format:

1. **Title**: Short phrase describing the decision
2. **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
3. **Context**: The forces at play, including technological, business, and team constraints
4. **Decision**: The response to these forces, clearly stating the direction taken
5. **Consequences**: The resulting context after applying the decision
6. **Alternatives Considered**: Other options that were considered and why they were not chosen
7. **References**: Any relevant references or resources
