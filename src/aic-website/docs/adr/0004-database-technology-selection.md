# [ADR-0004] Database Technology Selection

## Context

As part of our MACH architecture implementation ([ADR-0001](0001-adopt-mach-architecture.md)), we need to select appropriate database technologies for our microservices. In a microservices architecture, each service can potentially use the database technology that best fits its specific requirements.

We need to consider:
- Data consistency and integrity requirements
- Query patterns and complexity
- Scalability needs
- Performance requirements
- Operational complexity
- Team expertise
- Cost considerations

Different services in our architecture have different data storage needs:
- Transactional data with complex relationships
- Caching for performance optimization
- Full-text search capabilities
- Time-series data for metrics and monitoring
- Message queues for asynchronous communication

## Decision

We will adopt a polyglot persistence approach, using different database technologies for different use cases:

1. **PostgreSQL** as the primary relational database for:
   - Transactional data
   - Complex relationships
   - Data that requires ACID compliance
   - Services with complex query requirements

2. **Redis** for:
   - Caching
   - Session storage
   - Rate limiting
   - Pub/sub messaging
   - Leaderboards and real-time analytics

3. **Elasticsearch** for:
   - Full-text search
   - Log storage and analysis
   - Complex document querying
   - Analytics on semi-structured data

4. **Apache Kafka** for:
   - Event streaming
   - Message queuing
   - Event sourcing
   - Change data capture

Each microservice will own its data and expose it via APIs, following the database-per-service pattern where appropriate.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Right Tool for the Job**: Each service can use the database technology that best fits its requirements.
- **Scalability**: Different database technologies can be scaled independently based on their specific needs.
- **Performance**: Specialized databases can provide better performance for specific use cases.
- **Resilience**: Database failures are isolated to specific services rather than affecting the entire system.
- **Innovation**: Teams can adopt new database technologies for new services without migrating existing data.

### Negative

- **Operational Complexity**: Managing multiple database technologies increases operational overhead.
- **Learning Curve**: Team members need to learn and maintain expertise in multiple database technologies.
- **Data Consistency**: Maintaining consistency across different databases is challenging.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Different backup and recovery procedures for each database technology.
- **Monitoring and Alerting**: Need to set up monitoring and alerting for each database technology.

## Alternatives Considered

### Single Database Technology (PostgreSQL)

**Pros**:
- Simplicity in operations and maintenance
- Consistent backup and recovery procedures
- Team needs expertise in only one database technology
- Easier to maintain data consistency
- Well-understood scaling patterns

**Cons**:
- Not optimal for all use cases (e.g., caching, full-text search)
- Potential performance bottlenecks for certain workloads
- Single point of failure if not properly architected
- Limited flexibility for different service requirements

This option was rejected because different services have significantly different data storage requirements that are better served by specialized databases.

### NoSQL-Only Approach (MongoDB)

**Pros**:
- Schema flexibility
- Horizontal scalability
- Good performance for document-oriented data
- JSON-native data model aligns with API responses
- Good developer experience

**Cons**:
- Limited support for complex transactions
- Not ideal for data with complex relationships
- Query capabilities less powerful than SQL for certain use cases
- Potential data consistency challenges

This option was rejected because many of our services require the strong consistency and relational capabilities of a SQL database.

### Cloud-Managed Database Services

**Pros**:
- Reduced operational overhead
- Built-in high availability and disaster recovery
- Automatic scaling and performance optimization
- Managed backups and updates

**Cons**:
- Vendor lock-in
- Potentially higher costs at scale
- Limited customization options
- Network latency for hybrid deployments

This option was partially accepted - we will use cloud-managed database services where appropriate, but with a focus on technologies that can also be self-hosted to avoid vendor lock-in.
