# [ADR-0007] CI/CD Pipeline

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2023-07-01

## Context

As part of our MACH architecture implementation ([ADR-0001](0001-adopt-mach-architecture.md)), we need a robust Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the building, testing, and deployment of our microservices. A well-designed CI/CD pipeline is essential for achieving the agility and reliability promised by the MACH architecture.

Our CI/CD requirements include:
- Automated building and testing of code
- Security scanning and compliance checks
- Artifact management
- Deployment automation
- Environment promotion
- Rollback capabilities
- Audit trail and traceability
- Integration with our Kubernetes infrastructure
- Support for GitOps practices

## Decision

We will implement a hybrid CI/CD pipeline using multiple tools for different stages of the pipeline:

1. **GitHub Actions** for:
   - Source code triggers and validation
   - Building and unit testing
   - Lightweight security scanning
   - Artifact creation

2. **GitLab CI** for:
   - Comprehensive security scanning
   - Compliance checks
   - Integration testing
   - Performance testing
   - Artifact promotion

3. **Jenkins** for:
   - Complex deployment orchestration
   - Environment-specific configurations
   - Approval workflows
   - Custom deployment scripts
   - Legacy system integration

4. **ArgoCD** for:
   - GitOps-based deployments
   - Kubernetes manifest management
   - Deployment synchronization
   - Rollback capabilities
   - Deployment visualization

This hybrid approach will be implemented with clear handoffs between tools, using webhooks and API calls to trigger subsequent stages.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Best of Breed**: Leveraging the strengths of each tool for specific stages.
- **Flexibility**: Different teams can use familiar tools for their part of the pipeline.
- **Scalability**: Different components can be scaled independently.
- **Resilience**: No single point of failure in the CI/CD infrastructure.
- **Feature Richness**: Access to the full feature set of each tool.
- **GitOps Practices**: Strong support for GitOps with ArgoCD.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between build, test, and deploy stages.

### Negative

- **Complexity**: Managing multiple tools increases operational complexity.
- **Integration Effort**: Requires integration work between different tools.
- **Learning Curve**: Team members need to learn multiple tools.
- **Troubleshooting Challenges**: Issues may span multiple systems.
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Multiple systems to maintain and upgrade.
- **Potential Bottlenecks**: Handoffs between systems could become bottlenecks.

## Alternatives Considered

### Single CI/CD Tool (Jenkins)

**Pros**:
- Simplicity in operations and maintenance
- Consistent user experience across all stages
- No integration points between different tools
- Centralized configuration and management
- Extensive plugin ecosystem

**Cons**:
- Not optimized for all stages of the pipeline
- Single point of failure
- May not have best-in-class features for all requirements
- Scaling challenges for large-scale deployments
- Limited GitOps capabilities

This option was rejected because different stages of our pipeline have significantly different requirements that are better served by specialized tools.

### Cloud Provider CI/CD Solutions (AWS CodePipeline, Azure DevOps, GCP Cloud Build)

**Pros**:
- Tight integration with cloud provider services
- Managed infrastructure
- Built-in scaling
- Integrated security features
- Simplified operations

**Cons**:
- Vendor lock-in
- Limited customization options
- Potentially higher costs at scale
- Less flexibility for hybrid or multi-cloud deployments
- May require adapting processes to fit the tool

This option was rejected due to concerns about vendor lock-in and the desire for a cloud-agnostic solution.

### GitLab CI/CD Only

**Pros**:
- Integrated source code management and CI/CD
- Comprehensive feature set
- Built-in container registry
- Good Kubernetes integration
- Strong security scanning capabilities

**Cons**:
- Less flexible for complex deployment orchestration
- Limited integration with existing Jenkins workflows
- May require migrating source code to GitLab
- Less mature GitOps capabilities compared to ArgoCD
- Resource-intensive for large-scale deployments

This option was partially accepted - we will use GitLab CI for security scanning and compliance checks, but not as the sole CI/CD solution.
