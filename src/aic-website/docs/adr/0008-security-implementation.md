# [ADR-0008] Security Implementation

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2023-07-05

## Context

As part of our MACH architecture implementation ([ADR-0001](0001-adopt-mach-architecture.md)), we need a comprehensive security strategy to protect our distributed system. Security is particularly important in a microservices architecture due to the increased attack surface and the complexity of securing service-to-service communication.

Our security requirements include:
- Authentication and authorization
- Secrets management
- Network security
- Data encryption
- Certificate management
- Vulnerability scanning
- Compliance monitoring
- Audit logging
- Security monitoring and incident response

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive security strategy consisting of:

1. **HashiCorp Vault** for secrets management:
   - Centralized secrets storage
   - Dynamic secrets generation
   - Secret rotation
   - Encryption as a service
   - PKI and certificate management

2. **Keycloak** for authentication and authorization:
   - Identity and access management
   - Single sign-on (SSO)
   - OAuth2/OpenID Connect implementation
   - User federation
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)

3. **cert-manager** for TLS certificate management:
   - Automated certificate provisioning
   - Certificate renewal
   - Integration with Let's Encrypt
   - Kubernetes integration

4. **Network Policies** for network security:
   - Service isolation
   - Traffic control between namespaces
   - Ingress and egress rules
   - Defense in depth

5. **mTLS** for service-to-service communication:
   - Implemented through Kuma Service Mesh ([ADR-0003](0003-service-mesh-implementation.md))
   - Encrypted communication between services
   - Service identity verification
   - Zero-trust network model

These components will be deployed in Kubernetes in the `security` namespace using Helm charts, with appropriate resource allocations and high-availability configuration.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls.
- **Zero Trust**: No implicit trust between services.
- **Centralized Management**: Centralized management of secrets and identities.
- **Automation**: Automated certificate management and secret rotation.
- **Compliance**: Better position to meet compliance requirements.
- **Visibility**: Improved visibility into security events.
- **Scalability**: Security controls that scale with the application.
- **Standardization**: Consistent security patterns across services.

### Negative

- **Complexity**: Additional components to manage and maintain.
- **Performance Overhead**: Some security controls add latency.
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn multiple security tools and concepts.
- **Integration Effort**: Requires integration with all services.
- **Operational Overhead**: Additional operational procedures for security management.
- **Potential Bottlenecks**: Security services could become bottlenecks if not properly scaled.

## Alternatives Considered

### Cloud Provider Security Services (AWS KMS, IAM, ACM, etc.)

**Pros**:
- Tight integration with cloud provider infrastructure
- Managed services with reduced operational overhead
- Built-in scaling and high availability
- Regular updates and security patches

**Cons**:
- Vendor lock-in
- Limited customization options
- Potentially higher costs at scale
- Less flexibility for hybrid or multi-cloud deployments

This option was rejected due to concerns about vendor lock-in and the desire for a cloud-agnostic solution.

### Kubernetes Secrets Only

**Pros**:
- Simplicity in implementation
- Native Kubernetes integration
- No additional components to manage
- Lower operational overhead

**Cons**:
- Limited secrets management capabilities
- Secrets stored as base64-encoded (not encrypted at rest by default)
- No automatic rotation or dynamic secrets
- Limited audit capabilities

This option was rejected because it doesn't provide the comprehensive secrets management capabilities required for our security posture.

### Custom Security Implementation

**Pros**:
- Tailored to our specific requirements
- Full control over implementation details
- Potential cost savings
- No dependencies on third-party tools

**Cons**:
- Significant development effort
- Ongoing maintenance burden
- Risk of security vulnerabilities in custom code
- Reinventing the wheel

This option was rejected due to the development effort required and the availability of mature open-source alternatives.

### Spring Security + OAuth2 Proxy

**Pros**:
- Familiar to Java developers
- Good integration with Spring Boot services
- Extensive documentation and community support
- Flexible authentication and authorization options

**Cons**:
- Limited to Java services
- Requires consistent implementation across services
- No centralized management interface
- Limited support for non-HTTP protocols

This option was rejected in favor of a more language-agnostic and centralized approach with Keycloak.
