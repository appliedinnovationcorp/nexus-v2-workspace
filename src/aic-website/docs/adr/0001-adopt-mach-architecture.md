# [ADR-0001] Adopt MACH Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2023-06-01

## Context

The AIC Website project requires a modern, scalable, and flexible architecture that can support rapid development, easy integration with third-party services, and the ability to adapt to changing business requirements. The current monolithic architecture has several limitations:

- Difficult to scale individual components
- Tight coupling between frontend and backend
- Challenges in integrating with third-party services
- Limited flexibility for technology choices
- Slow deployment cycles
- Difficulty in implementing continuous delivery

We need an architecture that addresses these limitations and provides a foundation for future growth and innovation.

## Decision

We will adopt the MACH (Microservices, API-first, Cloud-native, Headless) architecture for the AIC Website project. This architecture consists of:

1. **Microservices**: Breaking down the application into small, independently deployable services organized around business capabilities.
2. **API-first**: Designing APIs before implementation, ensuring all functionality is accessible through well-defined interfaces.
3. **Cloud-native**: Building applications designed specifically for cloud environments, leveraging containerization, orchestration, and cloud services.
4. **Headless**: Decoupling the frontend presentation layer from the backend business logic and data, allowing multiple frontends to consume the same backend services.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Scalability**: Individual components can be scaled independently based on demand.
- **Flexibility**: Teams can choose the best technology for each service.
- **Resilience**: Failures in one service don't necessarily affect others.
- **Maintainability**: Smaller codebases are easier to understand and maintain.
- **Deployment**: Services can be deployed independently, enabling continuous delivery.
- **Integration**: API-first approach simplifies integration with third-party services.
- **Frontend Agility**: Headless architecture allows multiple frontends (web, mobile, IoT) to consume the same backend.
- **Future-proofing**: The architecture can adapt to changing business requirements and technologies.

### Negative

- **Complexity**: Distributed systems are inherently more complex to develop, test, and operate.
- **Operational Overhead**: More services mean more components to monitor, deploy, and maintain.
- **Network Latency**: Communication between services introduces network latency.
- **Data Consistency**: Maintaining data consistency across services is challenging.
- **Learning Curve**: Team members need to learn new tools, patterns, and practices.
- **Initial Development Speed**: Initial development may be slower due to the need to set up infrastructure and establish patterns.

## Alternatives Considered

### Improved Monolith

**Pros**:
- Simpler development and deployment
- Lower operational overhead
- No network latency between components
- Easier data consistency

**Cons**:
- Limited scalability
- Continued tight coupling
- Difficulty in adopting new technologies
- Slower release cycles

This option was rejected because it wouldn't address the fundamental scalability and flexibility issues.

### Serverless Architecture

**Pros**:
- No infrastructure management
- Automatic scaling
- Pay-per-use pricing model
- Focus on business logic

**Cons**:
- Vendor lock-in
- Cold start latency
- Limited execution time
- Debugging and monitoring challenges

This option was considered but deemed not suitable for all parts of the application, especially those requiring long-running processes or complex state management.

### Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

**Pros**:
- Service reusability
- Standardized service contracts
- Business-aligned services

**Cons**:
- Often relies on heavyweight middleware
- Typically less granular than microservices
- Can lead to large, monolithic services

This option was rejected in favor of microservices, which offer more granularity and flexibility.
