# [ADR-0009] Storage Solution

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2023-07-10

## Context

As part of our MACH architecture implementation ([ADR-0001](0001-adopt-mach-architecture.md)), we need reliable and scalable storage solutions for our Kubernetes-based infrastructure. Different components of our system have different storage requirements, including:

- Persistent storage for databases
- Object storage for media files, backups, and artifacts
- Shared storage for configuration and data exchange
- Backup and disaster recovery storage

We need to select storage solutions that provide:
- High availability and durability
- Scalability to handle growing data volumes
- Performance appropriate for different workloads
- Data protection and backup capabilities
- Kubernetes integration
- Cost-effectiveness

## Decision

We will implement a multi-tiered storage strategy consisting of:

1. **Longhorn** for persistent block storage:
   - Kubernetes-native distributed block storage
   - Used for database persistence (PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch)
   - Used for stateful applications requiring block storage
   - Configured with appropriate replication for high availability

2. **MinIO** for S3-compatible object storage:
   - Self-hosted S3-compatible object storage
   - Used for media files (CMS uploads, user content)
   - Used for backups and artifacts
   - Configured in distributed mode for high availability

3. **Velero** for backup and disaster recovery:
   - Kubernetes-native backup and restore
   - Integration with MinIO for backup storage
   - Scheduled backups of critical namespaces
   - Application-consistent backups

These components will be deployed in Kubernetes in the `storage` namespace using Helm charts, with appropriate resource allocations and high-availability configuration.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Kubernetes-Native**: All solutions are designed for Kubernetes.
- **High Availability**: Distributed architecture provides resilience.
- **Scalability**: Can scale horizontally as data volumes grow.
- **Flexibility**: Different storage types for different workloads.
- **S3 Compatibility**: Standard API for object storage.
- **Backup Integration**: Comprehensive backup and recovery capabilities.
- **Cloud-Agnostic**: Works across different cloud providers and on-premises.
- **Open Source**: No licensing costs and active communities.

### Negative

- **Operational Complexity**: Multiple storage systems to manage.
- **Resource Usage**: Requires significant resources for high availability.
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn multiple storage technologies.
- **Performance Tuning**: Requires careful tuning for optimal performance.
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Regular maintenance required for all components.
- **Integration Effort**: Requires integration with all services needing storage.

## Alternatives Considered

### Cloud Provider Storage Services (AWS EBS, S3, RDS, etc.)

**Pros**:
- Fully managed services
- Built-in high availability and durability
- Automatic scaling and performance optimization
- Integration with other cloud services
- Reduced operational overhead

**Cons**:
- Vendor lock-in
- Potentially higher costs at scale
- Limited control over implementation details
- Network egress costs for data transfer
- Less flexibility for hybrid or multi-cloud deployments

This option was rejected due to concerns about vendor lock-in and the desire for a cloud-agnostic solution.

### NFS or Other Network Storage

**Pros**:
- Simplicity in implementation
- Familiar to many system administrators
- Good performance for certain workloads
- Widely supported

**Cons**:
- Single point of failure unless carefully configured
- Performance limitations for high-throughput workloads
- Scaling challenges
- Limited object storage capabilities
- Not ideal for all Kubernetes workloads

This option was rejected due to concerns about scalability and performance for our distributed architecture.

### Ceph

**Pros**:
- Unified storage system (block, object, file)
- Highly scalable and distributed
- Strong consistency guarantees
- Mature and battle-tested
- Active community

**Cons**:
- Complex to set up and maintain
- High resource requirements
- Steep learning curve
- Requires careful tuning for performance
- Overkill for smaller deployments

This option was rejected due to concerns about complexity and resource requirements, though it may be reconsidered for future scaling.

### Rook

**Pros**:
- Kubernetes-native storage orchestrator
- Supports multiple storage providers (Ceph, EdgeFS, etc.)
- Automated management and scaling
- Good operator pattern implementation
- Active CNCF project

**Cons**:
- Additional abstraction layer
- Still requires underlying storage system expertise
- Relatively young project compared to some alternatives
- Complex failure scenarios
- Resource overhead of the operator

This option was considered but rejected in favor of more focused solutions for each storage type.
