The Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are now complete. Here's a summary of 
what has been implemented:

1. ADR Template and Structure:
   • Created a standardized ADR template
   • Set up a directory structure for ADRs
   • Created a README file explaining the ADR process
   • Established a consistent format for all ADRs

2. Core Architecture Decisions:
   • ADR-0001: Documented the decision to adopt MACH architecture
   • ADR-0002: Selected Kong as the API Gateway
   • ADR-0003: Chose Kuma for Service Mesh implementation
   • ADR-0004: Established a polyglot persistence approach with multiple database 
technologies
   • ADR-0005: Selected Ghost CMS for content management

3. Infrastructure Decisions:
   • ADR-0006: Defined the observability stack with Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, and 
Jaeger
   • ADR-0007: Established a hybrid CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI,
Jenkins, and ArgoCD
   • ADR-0008: Documented the security implementation with Vault, Keycloak, and 
cert-manager
   • ADR-0009: Selected storage solutions including Longhorn, MinIO, and Velero

4. Application Decisions:
   • ADR-0010: Chose Next.js with React as the frontend framework
   • ADR-0011: Established an event-driven architecture with Apache Kafka

5. Documentation and Relationships:
   • Created a summary document showing the relationships between ADRs
   • Updated the FEATURE-002-IMPLEMENTATION.md file to reference the ADRs
   • Provided a visual representation of how the ADRs relate to each other

Each ADR follows a consistent format that includes:
• Context: The forces at play and the problem being solved
• Decision: The specific technology or approach chosen
• Consequences: The resulting trade-offs and impacts
• Alternatives Considered: Other options that were evaluated and why they were 
rejected
• References: Additional resources for further reading

This comprehensive set of ADRs provides a clear record of the architectural 
decision-making process for the MACH architecture implementation, serving as 
valuable documentation for current and future team members.
