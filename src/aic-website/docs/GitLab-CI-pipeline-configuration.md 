The GitLab CI pipeline configuration is now complete. Here's a summary of what has
been implemented:

1. Root Configuration File:
   • Created a comprehensive .gitlab-ci.yml file in the project root
   • Defined all stages of the CI/CD pipeline
   • Configured jobs for each stage with appropriate rules and dependencies
   • Set up caching, artifacts, and environment variables

2. Modular Templates:
   • Created reusable templates for different aspects of the pipeline:
     • security-scan.yml: Security scanning jobs
     • testing.yml: Various testing jobs
     • deployment.yml: Deployment jobs for different environments
   • Demonstrated how to include these templates in the main configuration

3. Security Scanning:
   • Implemented SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
   • Added dependency scanning
   • Set up container scanning
   • Configured secret detection
   • Added license scanning

4. Testing Strategy:
   • Configured unit tests with coverage reporting
   • Set up integration tests with service dependencies
   • Added end-to-end tests using Playwright
   • Implemented performance testing with k6
   • Added visual regression testing

5. Deployment Pipeline:
   • Created deployment jobs for development and staging environments
   • Set up manual approval gates for production deployment
   • Implemented Jenkins integration for production deployment
   • Added GitOps workflow with ArgoCD

6. Documentation:
   • Created a comprehensive README explaining the pipeline
   • Documented environment variables and configuration options
   • Added diagrams and explanations of the pipeline flow
   • Provided troubleshooting guidance

7. Integration with Hybrid CI/CD Approach:
   • Aligned with ADR-0007 (CI/CD Pipeline)
   • Configured integration with GitHub Actions and Jenkins
   • Set up appropriate handoffs between tools

This implementation provides a robust GitLab CI pipeline that handles security 
scanning, compliance checks, and integration testing as part of the hybrid CI/CD 
approach defined in the architecture.
