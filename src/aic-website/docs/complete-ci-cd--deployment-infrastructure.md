comprehensive CI/CD pipeline and deployment 
infrastructure for the AIC Website microservices architecture. Let me 
summarize what has been implemented, building on the extensive work from 
our previous conversation:

## Complete CI/CD and Deployment Infrastructure

### CI/CD Pipelines Created:
1. GitLab CI/CD Pipeline (.gitlab-ci.yml):
   • Multi-stage pipeline with validation, testing, building, security 
scanning, and deployment
   • Automated testing for all microservices with proper database setup
   • Docker image building and pushing to Harbor registry
   • Security scanning with Trivy
   • Environment-specific deployments (dev, staging, production)
   • Slack notifications for pipeline status

2. GitHub Actions Workflow (.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml):
   • Parallel testing and building of all services
   • Container registry integration with GitHub Container Registry
   • Security scanning and SARIF upload
   • Kubernetes deployments with proper environment management
   • Coverage reporting with Codecov integration

### Kubernetes Deployment Manifests:
1. Individual Service Deployments:
   • **Auth Service**: JWT authentication with Vault secret integration
   • **User Service**: Profile management with Redis caching
   • **Content Service**: Media handling with S3 integration and AWS IAM 
roles
   • **Notification Service**: Email processing with both API and worker 
deployments

2. Infrastructure Components:
   • **PostgreSQL**: Production-ready with persistent storage, backups, and
health checks
   • **Redis**: High-availability setup with Sentinel for failover
   • **Ingress**: NGINX-based with SSL termination, CORS, rate limiting, 
and path-based routing

3. Advanced Features:
   • Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) for all services
   • Pod Disruption Budgets (PDB) for high availability
   • Network policies for security
   • Vault integration for secret management
   • Service mesh compatibility annotations

### Deployment and Operations:
1. Deployment Script (scripts/deploy.sh):
   • Comprehensive deployment automation
   • Infrastructure-first deployment order
   • Health checks and verification
   • Database migration execution
   • Status monitoring and cleanup options

2. Monitoring and Alerting (k8s/monitoring.yaml):
   • Prometheus rules for comprehensive alerting
   • Grafana dashboards for visualization
   • Alertmanager configuration for notifications
   • Critical and warning alert routing
   • Performance and availability monitoring

### Key Production Features:

Security:
• Vault integration for secret management
• Network policies for pod-to-pod communication
• SSL/TLS termination with Let's Encrypt
• Container image vulnerability scanning
• Service account isolation

Scalability:
• Auto-scaling based on CPU and memory metrics
• Load balancing across multiple replicas
• Resource requests and limits for all containers
• Persistent storage for stateful components

Reliability:
• Health checks and readiness probes
• Pod disruption budgets for zero-downtime deployments
• Database backups with retention policies
• Redis high availability with Sentinel

Observability:
• Distributed tracing with Jaeger integration
• Prometheus metrics collection
• Grafana dashboards for visualization
• Comprehensive alerting rules
• Log aggregation ready

This implementation provides a complete, production-ready CI/CD pipeline 
and deployment infrastructure that builds upon the comprehensive 
microservices architecture, Vault configuration, Jaeger tracing, and actual
service implementations we created in our previous conversation. The 
system is designed for enterprise-scale operations with proper security, 
monitoring, and automation practices.
